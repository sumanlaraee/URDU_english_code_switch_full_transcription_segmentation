SPEAKER_01 [274.00-281.00]:  Salam alaikum. Welcome to the first group KPR of the 2025.
SPEAKER_00 [281.00-285.00]:  We start the proceedings with the recitation of the Holy Quran,
SPEAKER_00 [285.00-290.00]:  of which I request Omar to please give the honors.
SPEAKER_00 [290.00-295.00]:  I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan.
SPEAKER_00 [295.00-299.00]:  In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.
SPEAKER_01 [0.00-5.00]:  The companions of the Fire and the companions of Paradise are not equal.
SPEAKER_01 [5.00-9.00]:  The companions of Paradise are the winners.
SPEAKER_01 [9.00-13.00]:  If We had sent down this Qur'an on a mountain,
SPEAKER_01 [13.00-18.00]:  you would have seen it as a mountain of fear and fear of Allah.
SPEAKER_01 [18.00-24.00]:  And such are the examples which We give to mankind, that they may reflect.
SPEAKER_01 [24.00-29.00]:  And Allah, who has no deity except Him,
SPEAKER_01 [29.00-34.00]:  Knows the unseen and the witnessed. He is the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
SPEAKER_01 [34.00-38.00]:  And Allah, who has no deity except Him,
SPEAKER_01 [38.00-43.00]:  The King, the Most Holy, the All-Selight, the All-Believer, the All-Compassionate, the All-Mighty,
SPEAKER_01 [43.00-45.00]:  the All-Compassionate, the All-Compassionate, the All-Compassionate,
SPEAKER_01 [45.00-49.00]:  Glorified is Allah, from whom they associate.
SPEAKER_01 [49.00-52.00]:  And Allah, the Creator, the All-Compassionate, the All-Compassionate,
SPEAKER_01 [52.00-54.00]:  to whom are the names,
SPEAKER_01 [54.00-55.00]:  the All-Mighty,
SPEAKER_01 [55.00-56.00]:  the All-Mighty,
SPEAKER_01 [56.00-59.00]:  who exalts all things in the heavens and the earth,
SPEAKER_01 [59.00-64.00]:  and He is the Most Gracious, the Most Wise.
SPEAKER_01 [64.00-68.00]:  The companions of Hell and Paradise are not equal.
SPEAKER_01 [68.00-71.00]:  The companions of Paradise are the winners.
SPEAKER_01 [71.00-74.00]:  If we had sent down this Qur'an on a mountain,
SPEAKER_01 [74.00-78.00]:  you would have seen it as a mountain of fear of Allah.
SPEAKER_01 [78.00-81.00]:  And such are the examples which We give to mankind,
SPEAKER_01 [81.00-83.00]:  that they may reflect.
SPEAKER_01 [83.00-87.80]:  He is the same Allah who knows what is hidden and what is not.
SPEAKER_01 [87.80-89.86]:  Who is kind and merciful.
SPEAKER_01 [89.86-92.78]:  He is the same Allah who is the only one who knows what is hidden and what is not.
SPEAKER_01 [92.78-100.44]:  The King, the Most Pure, the One who is clear from all evils, the One who gives peace, the One who is the Greatest, the Overwhelming, the Overpriced and the Greatest.
SPEAKER_01 [100.44-104.02]:  Allah is very pure through the things that He makes His members.
SPEAKER_01 [104.02-108.70]:  He is the same Allah who creates, who gives existence, who creates the Surah.
SPEAKER_01 [108.70-110.90]:  For Him are the very good names.
SPEAKER_01 [110.90-114.90]:  is the only thing that is in the heavens and the earth.
SPEAKER_01 [114.90-116.90]:  And that is the only thing that is in the heavens and the earth.
SPEAKER_00 [116.90-118.90]:  Dr. Nandani.
SPEAKER_00 [118.90-120.90]:  The first presentation by
SPEAKER_00 [120.90-124.90]:  Charles Nadim from My Water.
SPEAKER_02 [124.90-126.90]:  I have a
SPEAKER_02 [126.90-128.90]:  preamble.
SPEAKER_02 [128.90-130.90]:  Before
SPEAKER_02 [130.90-132.90]:  we get into the My
SPEAKER_02 [132.90-134.90]:  Water presentation.
SPEAKER_02 [134.90-136.90]:  First of all, thank you everybody because

SPEAKER_02 [138.90-140.90]:  earlier board meeting, group board meeting

SPEAKER_02 [142.90-144.90]:  extracted out one hour from there.
SPEAKER_02 [144.90-146.90]:  And we extracted
SPEAKER_02 [146.90-148.90]:  an additional half an hour from there
SPEAKER_02 [148.90-150.90]:  for a reason that we wanted to share
SPEAKER_02 [150.90-152.90]:  the group financials
SPEAKER_02 [152.90-154.90]:  with the team because you people are all
SPEAKER_02 [154.90-156.90]:  collectively contributing towards the

SPEAKER_02 [166.90-168.90]:  size of the group is and what it is.

SPEAKER_02 [182.90-184.90]:  so I just
SPEAKER_02 [184.90-186.90]:  and of course Arsalan is here.
SPEAKER_02 [186.90-188.90]:  Arsalan could you please do two
SPEAKER_02 [188.90-190.90]:  things. First of all
SPEAKER_02 [190.90-192.90]:  share the group overall budget
SPEAKER_02 [192.90-194.90]:  for the entire year 2025.
SPEAKER_02 [194.90-196.90]:  I know
SPEAKER_02 [196.90-198.90]:  this is out of course so I'll leave it.
SPEAKER_02 [198.90-200.90]:  So I just wanted to
SPEAKER_02 [200.90-202.90]:  share the
SPEAKER_00 [202.90-204.90]:  the
SPEAKER_00 [204.90-206.90]:  the
SPEAKER_00 [206.90-208.90]:  the
SPEAKER_00 [208.90-210.90]:  the
SPEAKER_02 [210.90-212.90]:  the
SPEAKER_02 [212.90-214.90]:  the
SPEAKER_02 [214.90-216.90]:  the
SPEAKER_02 [216.90-218.90]:  the
SPEAKER_00 [218.90-220.90]:  the
SPEAKER_00 [220.90-222.90]:  the
SPEAKER_00 [222.90-224.90]:  the
SPEAKER_00 [224.90-226.90]:  the
SPEAKER_02 [226.90-230.90]:  the the the thing is that
SPEAKER_00 [232.90-234.90]:  the the
SPEAKER_02 [234.90-236.90]:  the the
SPEAKER_02 [236.90-238.90]:  the
SPEAKER_02 [238.90-240.90]:  the
SPEAKER_02 [240.90-244.90]:  the
SPEAKER_02 [252.90-254.90]:  the
SPEAKER_02 [254.90-256.90]:  This is my view.
SPEAKER_02 [256.90-258.90]:  More?
SPEAKER_00 [258.90-260.90]:  Less than this.
SPEAKER_00 [260.90-264.90]:  How can the view be smaller?
SPEAKER_00 [264.90-266.90]:  More.
SPEAKER_00 [266.90-270.90]:  The Senate is full now.
SPEAKER_02 [270.90-272.90]:  Now it's high.
SPEAKER_02 [272.90-274.90]:  High?
SPEAKER_02 [274.90-276.90]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_02 [276.90-278.90]:  Okay?
SPEAKER_02 [278.90-280.90]:  Gentlemen, you can read this.
SPEAKER_02 [280.90-282.90]:  At the back.
SPEAKER_02 [282.90-284.90]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_02 [284.90-286.90]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_02 [286.90-292.90]:  So, gross revenue, net of tax is 3.5 billion.
SPEAKER_02 [292.90-299.90]:  And the YTT budget was also...
SPEAKER_00 [0.00-10.00]:  Almost. Well, if you look at the bottom line, if you look at the gross profit, we are almost 100% over there.
SPEAKER_00 [10.00-19.00]:  So that's a good achievement for the group, especially for the first quarter.
SPEAKER_00 [19.00-25.00]:  Now we have to see throughout the day who has contributed in which way to this entire profitability.
SPEAKER_00 [25.00-35.00]:  Bottom line, 57 million, Aatav Jogke projected thousand. So the reason I'm putting this number in front of you to start with is that of course there is an improvement.
SPEAKER_00 [35.00-46.00]:  If you look at 24 to 25 YTD on the right side of the right vertical, by this year our gross profit was 885, now it's 1 million.
SPEAKER_00 [46.00-54.00]:  Last year, same quarter we were 29 million negative. And now we are 57 million positive as a group.
SPEAKER_00 [54.00-55.00]:  So which is a 19.
SPEAKER_00 [55.00-60.00]:  So we have a 50 million improvement overall in the quarter. Approximately.
SPEAKER_00 [60.00-65.00]:  Can you zoom in?
SPEAKER_00 [65.00-67.00]:  Can you zoom in?
SPEAKER_00 [67.00-69.00]:  No, it's fine.
SPEAKER_00 [69.00-72.00]:  Can you see the people in the back?
SPEAKER_00 [72.00-74.00]:  Can you see them?
SPEAKER_00 [74.00-76.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_00 [76.00-80.00]:  You can drive the car.
SPEAKER_00 [80.00-82.00]:  When you are calling the number, you can drive the car.
SPEAKER_00 [82.00-84.00]:  Zoom in.
SPEAKER_00 [84.00-85.00]:  I'm driving.
SPEAKER_00 [85.00-87.00]:  Can you zoom in?
SPEAKER_00 [87.00-89.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_00 [89.00-103.00]:  Tutorial
SPEAKER_00 [103.00-109.18]:  So bottom line bottom line here is, this
SPEAKER_00 [109.18-112.00]:  one, the group last year closed its total Revenue at close to...What is there on that Revenue?
SPEAKER_00 [112.00-114.00]:  11 Million
SPEAKER_00 [114.00-118.00]:  11 billion.
SPEAKER_00 [118.00-120.00]:  Net of taxes.
SPEAKER_00 [120.00-127.00]:  This year, our expectation is that we will have a net of taxes of 14 billion.
SPEAKER_00 [127.00-133.00]:  We will close this year on 15 billion.
SPEAKER_00 [133.00-139.00]:  So overall, 25-30% growth is expected.
SPEAKER_00 [139.00-146.00]:  Now, the only thing left is that our PAT, which is at 2% PAT,
SPEAKER_00 [146.00-150.00]:  this has to improve considerably because we have always said it has to be initially,
SPEAKER_00 [150.00-156.00]:  our initial goal is to go between 5-7% and then 7-10% PAT.
SPEAKER_00 [156.00-162.00]:  And that is where we look at each and every company in this entire thing.
SPEAKER_00 [162.00-168.00]:  In this, because our optics and multinet meeting has already been held,
SPEAKER_00 [168.00-169.00]:  I just want to say that
SPEAKER_00 [169.00-174.00]:  I would like you to take me to the next page, Arsalan.
SPEAKER_00 [174.00-178.00]:  YTT again.
SPEAKER_00 [178.00-181.00]:  So we just noticed over there,
SPEAKER_00 [181.00-184.00]:  the profit of the group is 57 million.
SPEAKER_00 [184.00-186.00]:  And if you look at it that way,
SPEAKER_00 [186.00-189.00]:  67 million is multinet.
SPEAKER_00 [189.00-194.00]:  And if you combine both, it's almost 100 million.
SPEAKER_00 [194.00-197.00]:  And optics has 15 million.
SPEAKER_00 [197.00-198.00]:  So,
SPEAKER_00 [198.00-199.00]:  115 million,
SPEAKER_00 [199.00-207.00]:  the contribution is towards the net profit of 57 million to optics and multinet.
SPEAKER_00 [207.00-210.00]:  Do you want to join them?
SPEAKER_00 [210.00-215.00]:  Yes, I will join.
SPEAKER_00 [215.00-221.00]:  Yes, I will join.
SPEAKER_00 [221.00-223.00]:  He is with us?
SPEAKER_00 [223.00-225.00]:  Yes, he is with us.
SPEAKER_00 [225.00-227.00]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_00 [227.00-230.00]:  So,
SPEAKER_00 [230.00-232.00]:  now,
SPEAKER_00 [232.00-234.00]:  that's the thing.
SPEAKER_00 [234.00-238.00]:  We also understand that all the other companies and some of them have started up.
SPEAKER_00 [238.00-241.00]:  But when you compare it from last year,
SPEAKER_00 [241.00-246.00]:  all of them have improved and continue to improve.
SPEAKER_00 [246.00-255.00]:  Our job collectively is to make sure that the group goes to the bottom line of 5% to 7%
SPEAKER_00 [255.00-256.00]:  within the next 14 months.
SPEAKER_00 [257.00-260.00]:  12 to 15 months.
SPEAKER_00 [260.00-263.00]:  So, for that, we have to try our best and everyone's own.
SPEAKER_00 [263.00-267.00]:  Because multinet itself, which is in 57 million, projected 200,
SPEAKER_00 [267.00-269.00]:  if their target budget,
SPEAKER_00 [269.00-272.00]:  that's why I wanted to show the budget, it was 350 million.
SPEAKER_00 [272.00-275.00]:  I have already told you that it is 4.5 million.
SPEAKER_00 [275.00-276.00]:  On the bottom line.
SPEAKER_00 [276.00-278.00]:  In the same way, optics is also doing the same.
SPEAKER_00 [278.00-280.00]:  In the same way, everyone has been given their new targets.
SPEAKER_00 [280.00-281.00]:  So, you too,
SPEAKER_00 [281.00-284.00]:  so if the bigger companies are doing so proportionately,
SPEAKER_00 [284.00-286.00]:  companies who are coming of age,
SPEAKER_00 [286.00-287.00]:  over here,
SPEAKER_00 [287.00-290.00]:  they have to start contributing to the bottom line as well.
SPEAKER_00 [290.00-293.00]:  So, any questions, specific questions,
SPEAKER_00 [293.00-298.00]:  what you will notice is like my HCM and my water,
SPEAKER_00 [298.00-300.00]:  the gross profit margins, we have 79.
SPEAKER_01 [0.00-8.00]:  I don't know why 23% used to be over 50-55% but I'll have that discussion when they come.
SPEAKER_01 [8.00-11.00]:  Go to the next page.
SPEAKER_01 [11.00-25.00]:  So, where we have UAE is 59% per year, I'm talking about gross profit.
SPEAKER_01 [25.00-30.00]:  In which, where our technology firms are, they are over 50-60-65% of gross profit.
SPEAKER_01 [30.00-36.00]:  Unfortunately, most of them are not leveraged as much as in terms of loan etc.
SPEAKER_01 [36.00-38.00]:  Their reputation will improve accordingly.
SPEAKER_01 [38.00-41.00]:  But until this volume is not there and everyone will remain negative,
SPEAKER_01 [41.00-43.00]:  you have to understand that part.
SPEAKER_01 [43.00-48.00]:  But at least your gross profit at that time is there to be able to start going into this.
SPEAKER_01 [48.00-55.00]:  Now, when you take a deeper dive, so now you can see who's contributing how much to the negative parts of it in the profits.
SPEAKER_01 [55.00-58.00]:  So, you'll understand where this all is going.
SPEAKER_01 [58.00-64.00]:  One company that has now really remarkably done well starting this year is Albusaira.
SPEAKER_01 [64.00-71.00]:  And overall, Albusaira and Infinity is also now changing.
SPEAKER_01 [71.00-75.00]:  So, they are now moving into this new business.
SPEAKER_01 [75.00-80.00]:  My water is there but still needs to get out of its situation.
SPEAKER_01 [80.00-84.00]:  One thing is important for all the people.
SPEAKER_00 [84.00-89.00]:  This comparison is going on with budgets.
SPEAKER_00 [89.00-94.00]:  Yes, we are looking at 2024 but we are looking at budget.
SPEAKER_00 [94.00-96.00]:  Budget was submitted by you all.
SPEAKER_00 [96.00-100.00]:  You know, you have done your work, planning, taking time, and sessions, etc.
SPEAKER_00 [100.00-102.80]:  sessions and then you gave us numbers.
SPEAKER_00 [102.80-112.80]:  In numbers, there is a revenue number, then you gave a cross profit number, then you gave a beta number, then you gave a PAT number.
SPEAKER_00 [112.80-116.40]:  So, the board level is looking at everything.
SPEAKER_00 [116.40-119.20]:  Where was the revenue? What was the projection?
SPEAKER_00 [119.20-123.60]:  And we will ask why this revenue target was missed?
SPEAKER_00 [123.60-129.80]:  Because if any target is missed on the top line, its impact comes on the bottom line.
SPEAKER_00 [129.80-134.60]:  It's not about only that we have achieved the gross margin, then the numbers are done.
SPEAKER_00 [134.60-139.60]:  No, you need to achieve your target number because these numbers are the first quarter.
SPEAKER_00 [139.60-146.60]:  I assume that your planning should be such that the first quarter is an achievable number, right?
SPEAKER_00 [146.60-152.00]:  90 days, you should be achieving your target numbers because it is very close.
SPEAKER_00 [152.00-155.00]:  There may be a problem in the future for which you should work,
SPEAKER_00 [155.00-159.60]:  but the first quarter, second quarter of the beginning is a very relatively,
SPEAKER_00 [159.60-161.40]:  close milestone.
SPEAKER_00 [161.40-163.00]:  We have to achieve this.
SPEAKER_00 [163.00-167.40]:  So, with these numbers, we will move ahead now.
SPEAKER_00 [167.40-171.20]:  The rest of the companies will tell us about themselves.
SPEAKER_00 [171.20-174.00]:  The numbers are based, so what are you doing about it?
SPEAKER_00 [174.00-177.60]:  And how you are going to cover that in the next quarter?
SPEAKER_00 [177.60-183.40]:  Because we cannot just let it go that we have missed the top line of revenue and numbers.
SPEAKER_00 [183.40-189.40]:  So, I just wanted to tell you that we will look at the overall numbers from revenue to PAT.
SPEAKER_00 [189.60-193.40]:  And we will look at the overall numbers from the previous presentations.
SPEAKER_00 [193.40-194.40]:  So, this is the format?
SPEAKER_00 [194.40-195.40]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_01 [195.40-201.40]:  So, any questions, anything in, and quite honestly,
SPEAKER_01 [201.40-206.40]:  if whatever people need to understand, if they want to improve these presentations,
SPEAKER_01 [206.40-209.40]:  in whichever way you want, please, this is a good time to have that discussion.
SPEAKER_01 [209.40-210.40]:  Anybody would like to be able to.
SPEAKER_01 [210.40-214.40]:  Kumar?
SPEAKER_01 [214.40-217.40]:  Questions?
SPEAKER_00 [217.40-218.40]:  One thing is important.
SPEAKER_00 [218.40-219.40]:  One thing we missed in this.
SPEAKER_00 [219.40-226.20]:  So, what we can do is, we can keep in mind customer acquisition.
SPEAKER_00 [226.20-228.20]:  How many customers added?
SPEAKER_00 [228.20-236.20]:  Not about links, not about any other deployments, but how many new customers, what is the upsell?
SPEAKER_00 [236.20-238.20]:  How much is the upsell of an existing customer?
SPEAKER_00 [238.20-243.20]:  How much is the upsell in your revenue contribution and how much is the new business?
SPEAKER_00 [243.20-248.20]:  So that you will see that actually we are growing from our existing business, that is,
SPEAKER_00 [248.20-251.00]:  we are growing from existing customers or bringing new business.
SPEAKER_00 [251.00-255.00]:  So, whatever the activities we need to perform as teams, we need to understand that whether
SPEAKER_00 [255.00-258.00]:  we have to go out and do more farming or more hunting, right?
SPEAKER_00 [258.00-260.00]:  So, we just miss this.
SPEAKER_00 [260.00-261.00]:  We don't know that.
SPEAKER_00 [261.00-264.00]:  But that they should have in their quarterly reports.
SPEAKER_01 [264.00-266.00]:  Yes, if it is coming, then it is absolutely correct.
SPEAKER_01 [266.00-269.00]:  In this, it will just get a little too complex to understand that.
SPEAKER_01 [269.00-270.00]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_01 [270.00-273.00]:  Because all have different, you know, businesses, so in that existing.
SPEAKER_01 [273.00-274.00]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_01 [274.00-275.00]:  So, if everyone has covered.
SPEAKER_01 [275.00-276.00]:  If not, then it is okay.
SPEAKER_01 [276.00-277.00]:  If not, then it is okay.
SPEAKER_01 [277.00-278.80]:  If not, then it is okay.
SPEAKER_01 [278.80-279.80]:  But they should.
SPEAKER_01 [279.80-280.80]:  Yes, absolutely correct.
SPEAKER_01 [280.80-281.80]:  It will be in the quarterly report.
SPEAKER_00 [281.80-283.80]:  This is the budget in which you were saying.
SPEAKER_00 [283.80-288.80]:  Finally, I mean, some of this is minor.
SPEAKER_00 [288.80-289.80]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_01 [289.80-298.80]:  So, our revenue was 12.6 billion last year and this year we are expecting 16.264 billion.
SPEAKER_02 [0.00-9.00]:  So it's not 14.5. 27% increase.
SPEAKER_02 [9.00-16.00]:  20 billion is for 2026.
SPEAKER_02 [16.00-26.00]:  Profitability is our bottom line. Budget is 5%, which is 778 million.
SPEAKER_02 [26.00-35.00]:  Anybody slips, they will be taking a dip over here.
SPEAKER_02 [35.00-43.00]:  That's why it's the first quarter. This is the time to buckle up and deliver.
SPEAKER_02 [43.00-50.00]:  Everyone, collectively, each group, each leadership over here.
SPEAKER_02 [50.00-54.00]:  Zaheer? Yes, boss.
SPEAKER_02 [54.00-56.00]:  Any questions?
SPEAKER_02 [56.00-60.00]:  Sir, clear. Understood.
SPEAKER_02 [60.00-68.00]:  We'll do it that way. Kamran, Dhanesh, everybody okay with that?
SPEAKER_02 [68.00-70.00]:  Clear, sir.
SPEAKER_02 [70.00-72.00]:  Okay, fine.
SPEAKER_02 [72.00-74.00]:  Let those screen another.
SPEAKER_02 [78.00-84.00]:  So we will be tracing this 16 point some billion and bottom line overall.
SPEAKER_02 [84.00-86.00]:  And
SPEAKER_02 [86.00-90.00]:  everybody will have to contribute in the way they have made the budget.
SPEAKER_02 [90.00-96.00]:  With that, I will request MyWater.
SPEAKER_02 [96.00-102.00]:  MyWater's quarterly results will be taken on the screen first before we start the discussion.
SPEAKER_01 [102.00-104.00]:  Sorry, everyone.
SPEAKER_01 [104.00-106.00]:  With MyWater? Yes.
SPEAKER_00 [114.00-116.70]:  It will be fully piece of exactly what city level measure,
SPEAKER_00 [116.70-122.00]:  mistakes in forest and strait in consultation Primot.
SPEAKER_00 [122.00-124.00]:  It will be.
SPEAKER_02 [124.00-132.00]:  But it will have with you an entirely different term only presentation site often is foundation.
SPEAKER_01 [132.00-136.00]:  If I am not wrong to put my name.
SPEAKER_02 [138.00-140.00]:  Respect them.
SPEAKER_02 [140.00-142.00]:  Execute any odd bill.
SPEAKER_02 [142.00-144.00]:  roads are open, highways are open.
SPEAKER_02 [144.00-147.00]:  Yes, it seems that they are opening slowly.
SPEAKER_01 [148.00-151.00]:  They have stopped but lawyers have also tried to call off.
SPEAKER_01 [151.00-154.00]:  Lawyers have not tried to call off but still they are not sitting.
SPEAKER_01 [154.00-156.00]:  So, who are sitting? Are lawyers sitting or?
SPEAKER_01 [156.00-158.00]:  Lawyers are sitting.
SPEAKER_01 [160.00-164.00]:  Okay. Let's start. Next slide.
SPEAKER_01 [164.00-170.00]:  Before we see the quarterly results, this is a very important slide when it comes to MyWater.
SPEAKER_01 [170.00-177.00]:  Because it shows how MyWater is contributing towards overall environmental sustainability.
SPEAKER_01 [177.00-186.00]:  Because the funding that we get plays a very important role in terms of the impact that the organization is having on the environment.
SPEAKER_01 [186.00-192.00]:  If you see, the results of the last 5 years, and I think these numbers we should be proud of collectively as a group.
SPEAKER_01 [192.00-198.00]:  The customers of MyWater which are close to now 6000 units,
SPEAKER_01 [198.00-204.00]:  In 5 years, we have dispensed 77 million liters of clean water.
SPEAKER_01 [204.00-214.00]:  What that means is 154 million plastic bottles of 500 ml saved, eliminated from the environment.
SPEAKER_01 [214.00-221.00]:  And in terms of plastic, this is 1600 tons of plastic avoided from going into the ocean.
SPEAKER_01 [221.00-226.00]:  And 30,800 tons of CO2 per year which has been saved.
SPEAKER_01 [226.00-227.00]:  So, this is a very interesting study.
SPEAKER_01 [227.00-228.00]:  So, this is a very interesting study.
SPEAKER_01 [228.00-234.00]:  So, the thing is that one customer who is onboarding a MyWater dispenser for his office or home,
SPEAKER_01 [234.00-239.00]:  over a period of 5 years, that's equivalent to planting 6000 trees.
SPEAKER_01 [239.00-243.00]:  So, that's the contribution apart from the financial results.
SPEAKER_01 [243.00-249.00]:  MyWater is a company which is contributing towards environmental sustainability.
SPEAKER_01 [249.00-254.00]:  And you know Pakistan is one of the most vulnerable countries when it comes to global warming and climate disasters.
SPEAKER_01 [254.00-257.00]:  So, in that, we are playing our own small role in this.
SPEAKER_01 [257.00-260.00]:  So, we are playing our own small role in not only tackling the problem of water,
SPEAKER_01 [260.00-266.00]:  but in terms of getting rid of the greenhouse gases as well.
SPEAKER_01 [266.00-267.00]:  How many trees did you plant in a year?
SPEAKER_01 [267.00-268.00]:  6000 trees.
SPEAKER_01 [268.00-269.00]:  6000 trees.
SPEAKER_01 [269.00-270.00]:  In a year?
SPEAKER_01 [270.00-271.00]:  in a year.
SPEAKER_01 [271.00-272.00]:  In a year?
SPEAKER_01 [272.00-273.00]:  5 years.
SPEAKER_01 [273.00-274.00]:  5 years.
SPEAKER_01 [274.00-275.00]:  5 years?
SPEAKER_02 [275.00-276.00]:  Life of the...
SPEAKER_02 [276.00-277.00]:  Life of a dispenser.
SPEAKER_02 [277.00-278.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_02 [278.00-279.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_02 [279.00-280.00]:  Through the life of a dispenser.
SPEAKER_00 [280.00-281.00]:  Is it equivalent to the equivalent of 6,000 trees?
SPEAKER_00 [281.00-282.00]:  Yes, equivalent to 6,000 trees.
SPEAKER_00 [282.00-285.00]:  You are talking about one unit.
SPEAKER_00 [285.00-286.00]:  You are talking about one unit.
SPEAKER_00 [286.00-288.00]:  How is it possible?
SPEAKER_00 [288.00-290.00]:  This is a 5 year old collective.
SPEAKER_00 [290.00-292.00]:  How is it being made yearly?
SPEAKER_01 [292.00-294.00]:  It has made 15 to 18 million liters.
SPEAKER_00 [294.00-296.00]:  I would suggest that
SPEAKER_00 [296.00-298.00]:  its graph wise
SPEAKER_00 [298.00-300.00]:  will be good.
SPEAKER_00 [0.00-3.00]:  How much has My Water contributed year on year?
SPEAKER_00 [3.00-7.00]:  It will be less in the beginning, but it has reached here while growing.
SPEAKER_00 [7.00-13.00]:  I was talking about last time, put this slide at the end and we will talk about business first.
SPEAKER_03 [13.00-21.00]:  This is a good figure, but put it at the end.
SPEAKER_01 [21.00-23.00]:  Open the first slide of My Water.
SPEAKER_01 [23.00-28.00]:  I said that it is a lot of positive.
SPEAKER_00 [28.00-33.00]:  I said that it is a good number, but put it at the end.
SPEAKER_01 [33.00-47.00]:  My slide is good, but put it at the end.
SPEAKER_04 [47.00-49.00]:  Can I help you, sir?
SPEAKER_04 [49.00-53.00]:  Put it at the end too.
SPEAKER_04 [53.00-57.00]:  Right.
SPEAKER_04 [57.00-58.00]:  No, no.
SPEAKER_04 [58.00-60.00]:  I will tell you what is important.
SPEAKER_04 [60.00-64.00]:  What this slide does is, and I think,
SPEAKER_04 [64.00-66.00]:  I will tell you what is important.
SPEAKER_04 [66.00-69.00]:  What this slide does is, and I think,
SPEAKER_04 [69.00-75.00]:  I don't think any company at the moment over here amongst us has it.
SPEAKER_04 [75.00-80.00]:  They have received two loans at 50% loss.
SPEAKER_04 [80.00-83.00]:  They have received two loans at 50% loss.
SPEAKER_04 [83.00-87.00]:  They have received two loans at 50% loss.
SPEAKER_04 [87.00-89.00]:  Their two loans.
SPEAKER_04 [89.00-92.00]:  Not 50, but 28, 25.
SPEAKER_04 [92.00-94.00]:  You mean if they had 22%, they have got 8%.
SPEAKER_04 [94.00-95.00]:  8%.
SPEAKER_04 [95.00-96.00]:  We also had it.
SPEAKER_04 [96.00-97.00]:  30%.
SPEAKER_04 [97.00-98.00]:  We also had it.
SPEAKER_04 [98.00-99.00]:  We got 6.
SPEAKER_04 [99.00-100.00]:  Your 6% was from the state bank.
SPEAKER_00 [100.00-101.00]:  We got it from the cash deposit, right.
SPEAKER_00 [101.00-102.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_00 [102.00-103.00]:  We got it from the cash deposit.
SPEAKER_04 [103.00-104.00]:  2%.
SPEAKER_04 [104.00-105.00]:  No, no.
SPEAKER_04 [105.00-106.00]:  I don't know.
SPEAKER_04 [106.00-107.00]:  That was his.
SPEAKER_04 [107.00-110.00]:  You know, what I am saying is.
SPEAKER_04 [110.00-112.00]:  This is important for the financial.
SPEAKER_04 [112.00-113.00]:  Their state bank.
SPEAKER_04 [113.00-114.00]:  No, I am not.
SPEAKER_04 [114.00-115.00]:  He was himself.
SPEAKER_04 [115.00-116.00]:  No, no.
SPEAKER_04 [116.00-129.00]:  I am telling you that I am giving the answer of Baba.
SPEAKER_04 [129.00-139.00]:  Because you get 6% and nowadays who gets 8% and they are continuing on the same business that your number is over 7 million.
SPEAKER_04 [139.00-146.00]:  I hope that sort of.
SPEAKER_04 [146.00-154.00]:  In this slide, you write that this is commercial and give the slide number.
SPEAKER_02 [154.00-159.00]:  How much money is there for my water in this room?
SPEAKER_02 [159.00-164.00]:  What is written in the zoom out?
SPEAKER_02 [164.00-166.00]:  What?
SPEAKER_02 [166.00-168.00]:  848000 rupees.
SPEAKER_02 [168.00-169.00]:  848000 rupees.
SPEAKER_02 [169.00-170.00]:  In this room?
SPEAKER_03 [170.00-171.00]:  In this room alone.
SPEAKER_02 [171.00-172.00]:  Fantastic.
SPEAKER_03 [172.00-174.00]:  This is 849000 rupees per year.
SPEAKER_03 [174.00-175.00]:  No, no.
SPEAKER_03 [175.00-186.00]:  Yesterday, some other person came in the P2G group and he brought the group and he was asking a lot of questions.
SPEAKER_04 [186.00-189.00]:  Because he went to PTG and then he took my water.
SPEAKER_04 [189.00-193.00]:  There was a person who was asking me a lot of questions.
SPEAKER_04 [193.00-194.00]:  There was another person standing behind him.
SPEAKER_04 [194.00-197.00]:  Sir, I have been drinking for 4 years and I have not drunk any water.
SPEAKER_04 [197.00-198.00]:  He said that he is his own person.
SPEAKER_04 [198.00-199.00]:  He was asking, does your team help in calculating the ROI during the 7 months?
SPEAKER_03 [199.00-200.00]:  Of course.
SPEAKER_03 [200.00-201.00]:  I need it for my house and for my factory as well.
SPEAKER_03 [201.00-202.00]:  I connected it.
SPEAKER_03 [202.00-203.00]:  He said that I am his son and he is a big guest.
SPEAKER_03 [203.00-204.00]:  I will tell you that he is a big guest because his last name is Gharib.
SPEAKER_03 [204.00-205.00]:  Gharib is a real name.
SPEAKER_03 [205.00-206.00]:  Yesterday, I had a conversation with him and he had no problem.
SPEAKER_03 [206.00-207.00]:  I was saying that I am his son.
SPEAKER_03 [207.00-208.00]:  I am the son of the leader.
SPEAKER_03 [208.00-209.00]:  I have got my father's name.
SPEAKER_03 [209.00-210.00]:  I have got my father's name.

SPEAKER_02 [232.00-237.00]:  He came for condolence and he is posted in Sui.
SPEAKER_02 [237.00-238.00]:  And he's drank the water.
SPEAKER_02 [238.00-239.00]:  It tastes very nice.
SPEAKER_02 [239.00-240.00]:  He went immediately.
SPEAKER_02 [240.00-241.00]:  He said, I want two.
SPEAKER_02 [241.00-242.00]:  I said, I'll do it myself.
SPEAKER_02 [242.00-243.00]:  Give me two.
SPEAKER_02 [243.00-249.00]:  I want to do it myself.
SPEAKER_00 [249.00-260.00]:  I was just seeing that, by the grace of God, you know, the revenue, the performance, how beautifully it is wrapped.
SPEAKER_00 [260.00-264.00]:  Slightly shorter than 11 million.
SPEAKER_00 [264.00-269.00]:  Slightly with solid revenue generation in line with the expectations.
SPEAKER_00 [269.00-271.00]:  Oh my God.
SPEAKER_00 [271.00-272.00]:  This is not the expectation.
SPEAKER_00 [272.00-273.00]:  The expectation is the expectation.
SPEAKER_00 [273.00-276.00]:  The expectation was you will cross the numbers of revenue.
SPEAKER_00 [276.00-277.00]:  Let me briefly brief.
SPEAKER_03 [277.00-279.00]:  So let's move from the top.
SPEAKER_03 [279.00-280.00]:  Yes, please tell.
SPEAKER_03 [280.00-283.00]:  106 million was the target or the budget for.
SPEAKER_03 [283.00-284.00]:  Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_03 [284.00-285.00]:  The target.
SPEAKER_03 [285.00-291.00]:  We achieved that 94 million, which is 89% of the budgeted revenue.
SPEAKER_03 [291.00-295.00]:  If net revenue, then that stands at around 81 million.
SPEAKER_03 [295.00-297.00]:  So here the shortfall is about 10 million.
SPEAKER_03 [297.00-300.00]:  And in GP, 70% was.
SPEAKER_02 [0.00-2.88]:  the targeted so we are at 68%.
SPEAKER_02 [2.88-4.96]:  Bottom line, if we come to the beta,
SPEAKER_02 [4.96-8.04]:  we forecasted 11.4 million, we did 9.7.
SPEAKER_02 [8.04-10.76]:  Just a minute, just a minute, I have a question.
SPEAKER_00 [10.76-16.38]:  So, 7, 89, 11% is short, I said, okay, fine.
SPEAKER_00 [16.38-18.82]:  So, you must have improved something in the cost of goods.
SPEAKER_00 [18.82-19.44]:  Yes, yes, yes.
SPEAKER_00 [19.44-20.52]:  Okay, perfect.
SPEAKER_02 [20.52-29.80]:  Yeah. So, and then the bat forecasted was 15.9 million and we did 14.8.
SPEAKER_02 [29.80-34.36]:  So, there is a positivity on the overall bat.
SPEAKER_02 [34.36-36.02]:  However, on the top line,
SPEAKER_02 [36.02-38.96]:  the revenue was missed by around 10 million.
SPEAKER_02 [38.96-45.04]:  Is he is he the primarily is what my water does is a fundamental issue
SPEAKER_02 [45.04-47.98]:  and that is the growth capital or the runway that we
SPEAKER_02 [47.98-51.42]:  require to run this asset-heavy organization.
SPEAKER_02 [51.42-53.74]:  So, in that, according to Q1,
SPEAKER_02 [53.74-55.96]:  the forecast we had in terms of our funding,
SPEAKER_02 [55.96-57.80]:  we were not able to secure that.
SPEAKER_02 [57.80-59.74]:  And the delta of that is also not
SPEAKER_02 [59.74-62.80]:  the number of the Q1 numbers.
SPEAKER_02 [62.80-66.24]:  As you move on, I can explain it further.
SPEAKER_02 [66.24-70.18]:  We have covered a lot of operational expenses to cover that.
SPEAKER_02 [70.18-75.24]:  We have also tried to control the cost of goods and also the cost of services.
SPEAKER_02 [75.24-82.06]:  Because of this, the number of profitability we were able to match or even get better than the budgeted numbers.
SPEAKER_02 [82.06-89.26]:  However, on the top line, we need to work more harder in getting the growth capital to sustain the growth.
SPEAKER_02 [89.74-92.94]: おいد casts drop as as.
SPEAKER_00 [92.94-94.58]:  Food costs per capita.
SPEAKER_00 [94.58-97.64]:  They dont have to take advantage and pay for programs and support for the crops.
SPEAKER_00 [97.64-98.68]:  This has ventured towards anyway,
SPEAKER_00 [98.68-100.24]:  and that is what we see in the right direction.
SPEAKER_00 [100.24-102.82]:  So, food demand has to furtherasser Vale reden.
SPEAKER_00 [102.82-105.92]:  This while there are many crops,
SPEAKER_00 [106.60-108.96]:  There are
SPEAKER_00 [108.96-109.80]: 快 so loong
SPEAKER_00 [109.80-114.42]:  leftover people in the supply chain.
SPEAKER_00 [114.42-115.14]:  Now that I understand what you are saying.
SPEAKER_00 [115.14-116.18]:  A meeting againし
SPEAKER_00 [116.18-117.16]:  Financier He,
SPEAKER_00 [117.16-119.42]:  credit so last time,
SPEAKER_01 [119.42-119.62]:  Kinoshe Democratic's here, Assad.
SPEAKER_01 [119.62-119.72]:  I'd texto Harrison by Finance.
SPEAKER_01 [119.74-125.74]:  Is the investment coming this year?
SPEAKER_02 [125.74-127.74]:  I will give you a snapshot of the landscape.
SPEAKER_02 [127.74-132.74]:  This year, our total CAFX requirement is 215 million.
SPEAKER_01 [132.74-133.74]:  Right.
SPEAKER_02 [133.74-137.74]:  215 million to expand to a fleet size of 8,250.
SPEAKER_02 [137.74-138.74]:  Yeah.
SPEAKER_02 [138.74-142.74]:  Why did we expect that we will get 100 to 120 million?
SPEAKER_02 [142.74-145.74]:  We could only secure around 55 million from that.
SPEAKER_02 [145.74-148.74]:  We have focused on Q2.
SPEAKER_02 [148.74-150.74]:  What is the reason?
SPEAKER_02 [150.74-154.74]:  There was some engagement with some banks and some leasing companies.
SPEAKER_02 [154.74-157.74]:  That couldn't materialize at the right time.
SPEAKER_02 [157.74-159.74]:  But now we are very close.
SPEAKER_02 [159.74-166.74]:  We are very close to a company in securing 100 to 150 million in terms of getting the debt from them.
SPEAKER_02 [166.74-170.74]:  That will fuel our growth for this year.
SPEAKER_02 [170.74-174.74]:  It will help us reach the target of 8,000 units for this year.
SPEAKER_02 [174.74-175.74]:  So, what are you saying?
SPEAKER_02 [175.74-178.74]:  It will land somewhere in the next 3 to 4 weeks.
SPEAKER_01 [178.74-181.74]:  So, there is no need to revise your budget?
SPEAKER_01 [181.74-182.74]:  You are going to achieve that.
SPEAKER_01 [182.74-186.74]:  If we get that funding, we can get to 8,000 units.
SPEAKER_02 [186.74-188.74]:  Boss, this is the time.
SPEAKER_01 [188.74-192.74]:  Why are you saying if we get the funding, you are very close to closing it, right?
SPEAKER_01 [192.74-193.74]:  What are the...
SPEAKER_01 [193.74-195.74]:  Boss, I believe in Murphy's Law.
SPEAKER_02 [195.74-197.74]:  So, anything which goes wrong can go wrong.
SPEAKER_02 [197.74-199.74]:  But, like I said, I am very gung-ho about...
SPEAKER_02 [199.74-200.74]:  I believe in you.
SPEAKER_01 [200.74-201.74]:  So, I don't know Murphy.
SPEAKER_01 [201.74-204.74]:  I know you.
SPEAKER_02 [204.74-208.74]:  We had a meeting the day before yesterday with Doris.
SPEAKER_02 [208.74-210.74]:  They are very...
SPEAKER_02 [210.74-213.74]:  In fact, they told us about the planned disbursement plan.
SPEAKER_02 [213.74-216.74]:  The ticket size they told us is less.
SPEAKER_02 [216.74-218.74]:  We asked them for more money.
SPEAKER_02 [218.74-221.74]:  It will be done but it will take around 3 to 4 weeks.
SPEAKER_02 [221.74-222.74]:  3 to 4 weeks, yeah.
SPEAKER_02 [222.74-225.74]:  It will help us in...
SPEAKER_02 [225.74-229.74]:  The numbers we have budgeted for Q2, Q3 and Q4.
SPEAKER_01 [229.74-230.74]:  So, one thing I remember.
SPEAKER_01 [230.74-233.74]:  In the last year, you guys also told us that to reach 8,000 units,
SPEAKER_01 [233.74-237.74]:  that will get you to PAT positive.
SPEAKER_01 [237.74-238.74]:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01 [238.74-241.74]:  So, with this approach, I don't think you will be able to
SPEAKER_01 [241.74-242.74]:  get PAT approved this year as well.
SPEAKER_01 [242.74-244.74]:  No, we will get PAT positive.
SPEAKER_01 [244.74-245.74]:  8,000...
SPEAKER_01 [245.74-247.74]:  No, but you said that we will get less money.
SPEAKER_01 [247.74-249.74]:  Oryx is saying less to give money.
SPEAKER_01 [249.74-250.74]:  So, I don't know that...
SPEAKER_02 [250.74-254.74]:  Multiple avenues we are looking forward to today's funding.
SPEAKER_02 [254.74-257.74]:  Not only Oryx but there are certain banks also involved.
SPEAKER_02 [257.74-261.74]:  We haven't planned equity yet but we are focusing on debt only.
SPEAKER_02 [261.74-262.74]:  That money is from somewhere.
SPEAKER_02 [262.74-265.74]:  So, we have our journey.
SPEAKER_02 [265.74-269.74]:  See, we have around 6,000 units on the free land actually.
SPEAKER_02 [269.74-270.74]:  6,000 units.
SPEAKER_02 [270.74-273.74]:  There is a debt of around 2300 units.
SPEAKER_02 [273.74-275.74]:  Whatever funding we will get from this...
SPEAKER_02 [275.74-278.74]:  Okay, we have 7,000 units in this.
SPEAKER_02 [278.74-280.74]:  That means they are on the board now.
SPEAKER_02 [280.74-284.74]:  So, the funding we need right now is of 1350 units actually.
SPEAKER_02 [284.74-286.74]:  7,000 has come...
SPEAKER_01 [286.74-290.74]:  We have about 6,200 units of goods.
SPEAKER_02 [290.74-291.74]:  We have 700 units.
SPEAKER_02 [291.74-294.74]:  We have 700 units which are on the board right now.
SPEAKER_02 [294.74-296.74]:  They are undergoing the clearance process.
SPEAKER_02 [296.74-299.74]:  So, we have 6,200 units which we have to sell.
SPEAKER_02 [299.74-302.74]:  It is the reason for worry.
SPEAKER_00 [0.00-3.00]:  we have already oversell 200 units.
SPEAKER_00 [3.00-5.00]:  We will come and sell them.
SPEAKER_00 [5.00-8.00]:  So the delta is 1400 units which we have to order
SPEAKER_00 [8.00-10.00]:  and which we have to pay for the import.
SPEAKER_00 [10.00-14.00]:  So we will procure the number from the orange.
SPEAKER_00 [14.00-16.00]:  So at least this thing will be covered that
SPEAKER_00 [16.00-18.00]:  the amount of import we have to pay
SPEAKER_00 [18.00-21.00]:  then it is local. On average we are at 28000 per unit.
SPEAKER_00 [21.00-23.00]:  So it is just a simple case of money.
SPEAKER_03 [23.00-25.00]:  So you have increased the price.
SPEAKER_03 [25.00-27.00]:  What is the impact of that increase?
SPEAKER_03 [27.00-30.00]:  So in this revenue of 94 million.
SPEAKER_03 [30.00-33.00]:  Not now, that is two quarters back.
SPEAKER_00 [33.00-36.00]:  That was done in August.
SPEAKER_00 [36.00-38.00]:  What was the impact?
SPEAKER_00 [38.00-42.00]:  MRC increased by 2 million in a matter of 6 months.
SPEAKER_00 [42.00-44.00]:  But that was last year.
SPEAKER_00 [44.00-47.00]:  So this year we did not increase any price.
SPEAKER_00 [47.00-49.00]:  It was 10% increase.
SPEAKER_03 [49.00-51.00]:  Almost.
SPEAKER_03 [51.00-53.00]:  If you see this.
SPEAKER_03 [53.00-55.00]:  10-11%.
SPEAKER_03 [55.00-56.00]:  11% increase.
SPEAKER_03 [56.00-57.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_03 [57.00-60.00]:  And you have no plan to increase the MRC?
SPEAKER_03 [60.00-64.00]:  Our current ARPU AZ stands at 36-33.
SPEAKER_00 [64.00-69.00]:  By the end of this year this ARPU will go to around 4000.
SPEAKER_00 [69.00-74.00]:  And in the next 18 months this ARPU will be close to 5000 rupees.
SPEAKER_00 [74.00-77.00]:  The product has the value and the utility
SPEAKER_00 [77.00-80.00]:  that we will be able to get it out of the customer's pocket at 5000.
SPEAKER_00 [80.00-82.00]:  Subject to we give their premium services.
SPEAKER_00 [82.00-86.00]:  Our MyCare model if we do that, executed 100%.
SPEAKER_00 [86.00-89.00]:  Currently the market has the juice to give us 5000 rupees.
SPEAKER_00 [89.00-92.00]:  We have only 5000 rupees per head, per house.
SPEAKER_00 [92.00-96.00]:  Our target of 1 lakh per house is 500 million per annum.
SPEAKER_00 [96.00-99.00]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_03 [99.00-102.00]:  What is the pricing of Oryx?
SPEAKER_02 [102.00-104.00]:  What is the pricing of Oryx?
SPEAKER_02 [104.00-106.00]:  5 over plus 5.
SPEAKER_02 [106.00-111.00]:  We take Oryx for a while.
SPEAKER_02 [111.00-114.00]:  We have a bigger need than we have at this time.
SPEAKER_04 [114.00-117.00]:  We have a bigger need than we have at this time.
SPEAKER_04 [117.00-118.00]:  But it's a bit.
SPEAKER_04 [118.00-120.00]:  We have got Kaibor exempted.
SPEAKER_04 [120.00-122.00]:  We are talking to an organization.
SPEAKER_04 [122.00-124.00]:  They will finance Kaibor.
SPEAKER_04 [124.00-126.00]:  They will finance Kaibor.
SPEAKER_02 [126.00-128.00]:  The sheet number 1 that you are saying.
SPEAKER_02 [128.00-129.00]:  On the basis of that.
SPEAKER_02 [129.00-130.00]:  On the basis of that.
SPEAKER_02 [130.00-131.00]:  Kaibor.
SPEAKER_02 [131.00-132.00]:  It's a low low.
SPEAKER_02 [132.00-133.00]:  No, we are planning.
SPEAKER_02 [133.00-135.00]:  Kaibor is free.
SPEAKER_04 [135.00-136.00]:  It is of 150 million.
SPEAKER_04 [136.00-138.00]:  Hopefully, we have up to 100 million of Kaibor.
SPEAKER_04 [138.00-139.00]:  We will take care of the time.
SPEAKER_02 [139.00-140.00]:  We have received the money.
SPEAKER_02 [140.00-141.00]:  One plus.
SPEAKER_02 [141.00-142.00]:  No, no, no.
SPEAKER_04 [142.00-143.00]:  It has not yet had an impact.
SPEAKER_04 [143.00-145.00]:  I think it was 11 million to 8 million.
SPEAKER_04 [145.00-146.00]:  It is less than 1 million.
SPEAKER_04 [146.00-148.00]:  In fact, some principles we have more loans.
SPEAKER_04 [148.00-149.00]:  We have repaid it.
SPEAKER_04 [149.00-150.00]:  Then the budget will also be.
SPEAKER_04 [150.00-151.00]:  Then the budget will also be.
SPEAKER_04 [151.00-152.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_04 [152.00-153.00]:  So that is less.
SPEAKER_04 [153.00-154.00]:  Because of that, 4 million is also different.
SPEAKER_04 [154.00-155.00]:  And this period.
SPEAKER_03 [155.00-156.00]:  This number is shaken.
SPEAKER_03 [156.00-157.00]:  This number is shaken because of this.
SPEAKER_03 [157.00-158.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_03 [158.00-159.00]:  We have some financing that was expected.
SPEAKER_03 [159.00-160.00]:  We budgeted in the quarter.
SPEAKER_03 [160.00-161.00]:  That is not.
SPEAKER_03 [161.00-162.00]:  That is not.
SPEAKER_04 [162.00-163.00]:  Because of that.
SPEAKER_04 [163.00-164.00]:  Because of that.
SPEAKER_04 [164.00-165.00]:  His payment did not do.
SPEAKER_04 [165.00-166.00]:  It will fall to 5 percent.
SPEAKER_04 [166.00-167.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_02 [167.00-168.00]:  If the budget comes from there.
SPEAKER_02 [168.00-169.00]:  Then.
SPEAKER_02 [169.00-170.00]:  That is it.
SPEAKER_02 [170.00-171.00]:  It is not.
SPEAKER_02 [171.00-172.00]:  Then.
SPEAKER_02 [172.00-174.00]:  But now, the Oryx is not going up to 60 million.
SPEAKER_01 [174.00-175.00]:  We said if you want to give, then you give us a full hundred.
SPEAKER_01 [175.00-176.00]:  Because now we have that letter, which is read.
SPEAKER_01 [176.00-177.00]:  That which is read.
SPEAKER_01 [177.00-178.00]:  So as you said, there are more people.
SPEAKER_01 [178.00-179.00]:  We have a party which is only sponsors.
SPEAKER_01 [179.00-180.00]:  What is the matter?
SPEAKER_01 [180.00-181.00]:  Up to 150 million.
SPEAKER_01 [181.00-182.00]:  But Oryx, they broke it.
SPEAKER_01 [182.00-183.00]:  Now take a shot.
SPEAKER_01 [183.00-184.00]:  Now.
SPEAKER_01 [184.00-185.00]:  This is how it is.
SPEAKER_01 [185.00-186.00]:  Oryx people walk a little like this.
SPEAKER_01 [186.00-187.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_01 [187.00-188.00]:  Oryx by the way.
SPEAKER_01 [188.00-189.00]:  By the way.
SPEAKER_01 [189.00-190.00]:  By the way.
SPEAKER_01 [190.00-191.00]:  By the way.

SPEAKER_02 [195.00-196.00]:  By the way.
SPEAKER_02 [196.00-197.00]:  By the way.
SPEAKER_02 [197.00-198.00]:  By the way.
SPEAKER_02 [198.00-199.00]:  By the way.
SPEAKER_02 [199.00-200.00]:  By the way.
SPEAKER_01 [200.00-201.00]:  By the way.
SPEAKER_01 [201.00-202.00]:  By the way.
SPEAKER_01 [202.00-207.00]:  Oryx also had those people on it, who first got the Multinet in 2002 and 2003, Oryx gave it
SPEAKER_01 [207.00-208.00]:  first.
SPEAKER_01 [208.00-210.00]:  And those people also came in the meeting.
SPEAKER_01 [210.00-211.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_01 [211.00-212.00]:  I think.
SPEAKER_01 [212.00-213.00]:  Who did this office.
SPEAKER_01 [213.00-214.00]:  This was the meeting, right?
SPEAKER_01 [214.00-215.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_01 [215.00-216.00]:  My Water.
SPEAKER_01 [216.00-217.00]:  No, I forgot.
SPEAKER_01 [217.00-218.00]:  Yes, My Water.
SPEAKER_01 [218.00-219.00]:  I took it in 2015 too.
SPEAKER_01 [219.00-220.00]:  You know, I took it in 2015 for the last time.
SPEAKER_01 [220.00-221.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_01 [221.00-222.00]:  I took it with the generator.

SPEAKER_02 [223.00-224.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_02 [224.00-225.00]:  Since 2002.
SPEAKER_01 [225.00-226.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_01 [226.00-227.00]:  So it was good.
SPEAKER_01 [227.00-228.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_01 [228.00-229.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_01 [229.00-230.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_02 [232.00-237.00]:  The internet driver was taking his how to drive in the 2017 Multinet.
SPEAKER_02 [237.00-238.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_02 [238.00-239.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_02 [239.00-240.00]:  He said this.
SPEAKER_01 [240.00-241.00]:  He he said this.
SPEAKER_01 [241.00-244.00]:  Sir did he get to drive that MANIOs.
SPEAKER_01 [244.00-245.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_01 [245.00-246.00]:  Sir did you get to drive that MANIOs?
SPEAKER_03 [246.00-247.00]:  Yes Sir did.
SPEAKER_03 [247.00-248.00]:  Okay sir did.
SPEAKER_03 [248.00-253.34]:  megaphone strap didn't yes sir did exactly, now we had DC grant and I came up with a
SPEAKER_02 [253.34-259.36]:  proposal for MY sympathize
SPEAKER_00 [259.36-259.98]: 달.
SPEAKER_00 [260.00-263.00]:  and the past 31 million.
SPEAKER_04 [263.00-266.00]:  Should we go below the beta?
SPEAKER_04 [266.00-268.00]:  No, we should go below the beta.
SPEAKER_03 [268.00-272.00]:  527 means that 81 is achieved.
SPEAKER_03 [272.00-274.00]:  In the last 3 quarters, it was very jumbled.
SPEAKER_03 [274.00-276.00]:  Yes, sir, look at that, 200 million.
SPEAKER_03 [276.00-280.00]:  If we do 170 million every month, then we will be complete.
SPEAKER_03 [280.00-282.00]:  Not 170 million every month.
SPEAKER_03 [282.00-284.00]:  We will take quarter.
SPEAKER_03 [284.00-286.00]:  We will have to double it.
SPEAKER_00 [286.00-289.00]:  Look, why is our season on buy only?
SPEAKER_00 [289.00-292.00]:  I am saying, I am calculating correctly.
SPEAKER_04 [292.00-295.00]:  You have shown it, we have confidence in you.
SPEAKER_03 [295.00-297.00]:  You are Murphy's Law for us.
SPEAKER_03 [297.00-300.00]:  Farooq Murphy, you are for us.
SPEAKER_01 [0.00-6.00]:  I asked this question that are you ready?
SPEAKER_01 [6.00-9.00]:  Good. Good luck.
SPEAKER_00 [9.00-16.00]:  If you need from us, then you can contact us through our finance.
SPEAKER_01 [16.00-21.00]:  If you need borrowing, we are ready for 10-12%.
SPEAKER_01 [21.00-23.00]:  We will take it from them.
SPEAKER_00 [23.00-25.00]:  We are paying for it.
SPEAKER_00 [25.00-27.00]:  We will do it through them.
SPEAKER_00 [27.00-32.00]:  We give you revenue.
SPEAKER_01 [32.00-34.00]:  We give you business.
SPEAKER_01 [34.00-36.00]:  We don't get anything.
SPEAKER_00 [36.00-38.00]:  This is a request.
SPEAKER_00 [38.00-41.00]:  Every startup goes through its pangs of difficulties.
SPEAKER_00 [41.00-43.00]:  If it is a startup.
SPEAKER_00 [43.00-45.00]:  There is no startup for 5 years.
SPEAKER_00 [45.00-47.00]:  No.
SPEAKER_01 [47.00-50.00]:  Amazon made its first profit in October.
SPEAKER_01 [50.00-53.00]:  Even Snap hasn't made a single dollar.
SPEAKER_00 [53.00-57.00]:  The survival stage in My Water,
SPEAKER_00 [57.00-59.00]:  it has crossed that stage.
SPEAKER_00 [59.00-64.00]:  Now we are at that stage where we just have to grow.
SPEAKER_00 [64.00-67.00]:  This is the stage where we need the funding right now.
SPEAKER_00 [67.00-71.00]:  We have been in competition for 3-4 years.
SPEAKER_00 [71.00-74.00]:  If we don't get the right funding right now,
SPEAKER_00 [74.00-77.00]:  the competition will come from behind.
SPEAKER_00 [77.00-78.00]:  They might come with deep pockets.
SPEAKER_00 [78.00-81.00]:  Maybe Nestle will come or some Aquafina will come.
SPEAKER_00 [81.00-86.00]:  So you were saying that my Multinet can support.
SPEAKER_00 [86.00-88.00]:  Wherever Multinet can support.
SPEAKER_00 [88.00-93.00]:  Because we don't have any problem except for getting the funds and getting the units deployed.
SPEAKER_00 [93.00-96.00]:  There is no other thing which is stopping us right now.
SPEAKER_00 [96.00-98.00]:  There is market.
SPEAKER_00 [98.00-100.00]:  There is traction.
SPEAKER_00 [100.00-102.00]:  We just need the right capital.
SPEAKER_01 [102.00-104.00]:  The only problem that I see,
SPEAKER_01 [104.00-107.00]:  and I can help you, Multinet can help you with some numbers.
SPEAKER_01 [107.00-109.00]:  But the only problem that I see is
SPEAKER_01 [109.00-111.00]:  you are not a good paymaster.
SPEAKER_01 [111.00-115.00]:  And we cannot keep on investing in My Water or any other business
SPEAKER_01 [115.00-117.00]:  that we have.
SPEAKER_01 [117.00-119.00]:  If you commit something,
SPEAKER_01 [119.00-121.00]:  and we have discussed this before,
SPEAKER_01 [121.00-123.00]:  I still remember the IPL income.
SPEAKER_01 [123.00-125.00]:  The payment is still low.
SPEAKER_01 [125.00-127.00]:  You cannot do that.
SPEAKER_01 [127.00-129.00]:  So if I try to do something,
SPEAKER_01 [129.00-131.00]:  I need that money back.
SPEAKER_01 [131.00-134.00]:  Because I have other projects to fund.
SPEAKER_01 [134.00-136.00]:  On that particular point.
SPEAKER_01 [136.00-138.00]:  For that, I cannot rely on
SPEAKER_01 [138.00-141.00]:  that it will be done tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
SPEAKER_01 [141.00-143.00]:  So for that, if you are ready,
SPEAKER_01 [143.00-144.00]:  Arsalan is ready,
SPEAKER_01 [144.00-146.00]:  I can look into some numbers.
SPEAKER_01 [146.00-148.00]:  I can help you with some numbers.
SPEAKER_01 [148.00-150.00]:  But then it should be a firm commitment.
SPEAKER_01 [150.00-153.00]:  I do not want to involve Baba ke Baba recovery.
SPEAKER_01 [153.00-154.00]:  I have gone mad.
SPEAKER_01 [154.00-156.00]:  Baba, please do recovery from them.
SPEAKER_01 [156.00-157.00]:  I cannot do this.
SPEAKER_01 [157.00-159.00]:  So commitment should be commitment on this part.
SPEAKER_01 [159.00-161.00]:  If you are ready, then I can.
SPEAKER_01 [161.00-163.00]:  Umar and I can work.
SPEAKER_01 [163.00-165.00]:  So we have routed the revenue.
SPEAKER_01 [165.00-167.00]:  The rent that is made for them,
SPEAKER_01 [167.00-169.00]:  we do not take all of it.
SPEAKER_01 [169.00-170.00]:  We show the revenue.
SPEAKER_01 [170.00-172.00]:  Because there is not much revenue coming there.
SPEAKER_01 [172.00-174.00]:  There is less collection there.
SPEAKER_01 [174.00-176.00]:  So they are running their backboard on it.
SPEAKER_01 [176.00-177.00]:  I mean, I am talking about it.
SPEAKER_01 [177.00-179.00]:  MyBottle has made it a customer.
SPEAKER_01 [179.00-180.00]:  No, no, I understood.
SPEAKER_01 [180.00-181.00]:  You are a channel.
SPEAKER_01 [181.00-184.00]:  Actually, I feel you were understanding something else.
SPEAKER_00 [184.00-186.00]:  Anyway, yeah, I understand.
SPEAKER_00 [186.00-187.00]:  Yeah.
SPEAKER_01 [187.00-189.00]:  I, I have never been there.
SPEAKER_00 [189.00-191.00]:  I passed yesterday.
SPEAKER_00 [191.00-193.00]:  No, no, I was shocked.
SPEAKER_00 [193.00-194.00]:  I told you.
SPEAKER_00 [194.00-196.00]:  You made an idea by mistake.
SPEAKER_01 [196.00-197.00]:  No, no, I told you.
SPEAKER_01 [197.00-198.00]:  I told you that the revenue came.
SPEAKER_01 [198.00-199.00]:  No, no, okay, okay.
SPEAKER_01 [199.00-201.00]:  You are not making a deal.
SPEAKER_00 [201.00-202.00]:  You are not making a deal.
SPEAKER_00 [202.00-203.00]:  You are not making a deal.
SPEAKER_00 [203.00-204.00]:  No, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_00 [204.00-206.00]:  He was saying that in the morning,
SPEAKER_00 [206.00-209.00]:  you had asked him about his Pakistan,
SPEAKER_00 [209.00-214.00]:  and he said that there will be some interest in IPL too.
SPEAKER_00 [214.00-216.00]:  I understood that there will be no IPL.
SPEAKER_00 [216.00-219.00]:  I said, what is this MyBottle connection?
SPEAKER_00 [219.00-221.00]:  First, what are they taking water?
SPEAKER_00 [221.00-222.00]:  Alright.
SPEAKER_00 [222.00-226.00]:  So this is Q1 2024 to Q1 2025.
SPEAKER_00 [226.00-229.00]:  So 32% growth in the gross revenue,
SPEAKER_00 [229.00-232.00]:  net revenue is 31%,
SPEAKER_00 [232.00-233.00]:  31%.
SPEAKER_00 [233.00-238.00]:  And in GP there is a slight decrease of 71 to 68%.
SPEAKER_00 [238.00-241.00]:  But overall the revenue has grown from last year.
SPEAKER_00 [241.00-249.00]:  So 23 million net growth from Q1, March 2024.
SPEAKER_00 [249.00-251.00]:  No, here the revenue is growing.
SPEAKER_00 [251.00-253.00]:  In revenue or in beta?
SPEAKER_00 [253.00-256.00]:  In beta, yes, gross growth is maybe 44 to 75%.
SPEAKER_00 [256.00-259.00]:  What is the growth in units?
SPEAKER_00 [259.00-261.00]:  What is the growth in units?
SPEAKER_00 [261.00-262.00]:  Around 1100 units.
SPEAKER_00 [262.00-266.00]:  So in March, there were 5000 something?
SPEAKER_01 [266.00-268.00]:  4500.
SPEAKER_00 [268.00-269.00]:  4500.
SPEAKER_00 [269.00-270.00]:  And now?
SPEAKER_00 [270.00-271.00]:  5600.
SPEAKER_00 [271.00-274.00]:  Okay, so the dynamics of business,
SPEAKER_00 [274.00-276.00]:  in our dispenser,
SPEAKER_00 [276.00-278.00]:  there are 142 parts.
SPEAKER_00 [278.00-280.00]:  Out of 142,
SPEAKER_00 [280.00-284.00]:  almost 55% is imported.
SPEAKER_00 [284.00-287.00]:  45% is done locally.
SPEAKER_00 [287.00-288.00]:  Now we are doing localization too,
SPEAKER_00 [288.00-289.00]:  especially the plastic parts,
SPEAKER_00 [289.00-291.00]:  which is most important for us.
SPEAKER_00 [291.00-293.00]:  This year we have,
SPEAKER_00 [293.00-295.00]:  thanks to Mr. Udman,
SPEAKER_00 [295.00-296.00]:  we will show you now,
SPEAKER_00 [296.00-297.00]:  we will also give a demonstration of it.
SPEAKER_00 [297.00-298.00]:  We have,
SPEAKER_00 [298.00-299.00]:  the plastic parts,
SPEAKER_00 [299.00-300.00]:  we have,
SPEAKER_04 [0.00-2.00]:  So, that will help bring the cost down.
SPEAKER_04 [2.00-6.00]:  So, the dynamics of My Water as a business, it's a bit different.
SPEAKER_04 [6.00-10.00]:  It looks superficially a very easy thing to sell, a dispenser and sell water.
SPEAKER_04 [10.00-15.00]:  But the nuts and bolts inside it, they are very dynamic.
SPEAKER_04 [15.00-20.00]:  No, no, in this era, after the COVID, it is clear that it is not easy to earn money.
SPEAKER_02 [20.00-24.00]:  It's My Water, Multinet, or Bex, or Amazon.
SPEAKER_02 [24.00-26.00]:  It's a dynamic.
SPEAKER_02 [26.00-28.00]:  It's not easy.
SPEAKER_02 [28.00-30.00]:  You have other challenges.
SPEAKER_02 [30.00-32.00]:  Everyone has their own challenges.
SPEAKER_02 [32.00-38.00]:  The important thing is how we can bring our efficiency and innovation to bring our cost down and increase the revenue.
SPEAKER_02 [38.00-40.00]:  Next.
SPEAKER_02 [40.00-46.00]:  This is the total MRC for the first three months, 60.9 and 363 units.
SPEAKER_04 [46.00-50.00]:  So, easy our production capacity is to be able to sell water.
SPEAKER_04 [50.00-52.00]:  So, the cost of the water is very low.
SPEAKER_04 [52.00-54.00]:  So, the cost of the water is very low.
SPEAKER_04 [54.00-56.00]:  So, the cost of the water is very low.
SPEAKER_04 [56.00-61.00]:  Our capacity is based on, we can produce 30 units a day right now.
SPEAKER_04 [61.00-64.00]:  So, we can make 700-800 units in a month.
SPEAKER_04 [64.00-70.00]:  But due to the funding and the availability of the growth capital.
SPEAKER_01 [70.00-74.00]:  What is the amount per unit?
SPEAKER_01 [74.00-76.00]:  28,000.
SPEAKER_01 [76.00-78.00]:  Per unit.
SPEAKER_01 [78.00-84.00]:  So, we have the money to produce 85-90 units.
SPEAKER_04 [84.00-86.00]:  85-90 units.
SPEAKER_04 [86.00-88.00]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_04 [88.00-92.00]:  And our sales are creeping up for the past three months on average.
SPEAKER_04 [92.00-94.00]:  We are selling around 170, 165, 170.
SPEAKER_04 [94.00-101.00]:  This is the first month we have crossed the 200-unit mark in the month of April.
SPEAKER_02 [101.00-107.00]:  So, that is the reason why our units deployed is on the lower side.
SPEAKER_04 [107.00-108.00]:  Next.
SPEAKER_03 [108.00-114.00]:  But in the beginning of the year, according to the sales growth, we did not have the units available in the opening.
SPEAKER_03 [114.00-116.00]:  We did not have the units available in the opening.
SPEAKER_03 [116.00-118.00]:  Then we had to sell them.
SPEAKER_03 [118.00-120.00]:  So, then our revenue.
SPEAKER_03 [120.00-123.00]:  So, in that, our units are of five types.
SPEAKER_04 [123.00-128.00]:  One is Terra, one is Solace, one is NEO, then there is MS03.
SPEAKER_04 [128.00-133.00]:  So, for example, if we have forecasted 500 units, then we sold 150 of MS02.
SPEAKER_04 [133.00-136.00]:  The rates of MS02 have gone up and MS02 has stopped.
SPEAKER_04 [136.00-137.00]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_04 [137.00-139.00]:  Its inventory ran out of the inventory.
SPEAKER_04 [139.00-142.00]:  And then now we are selling MS03 in that case.
SPEAKER_04 [142.00-144.00]:  Now we are selling NEO2.
SPEAKER_04 [144.00-145.00]:  We are balancing all that.
SPEAKER_04 [145.00-146.00]:  So, we are balancing all that.
SPEAKER_04 [146.00-147.00]:  So, that is where the issue is.
SPEAKER_03 [147.00-148.00]:  So, that is where the issue is.
SPEAKER_03 [148.00-152.00]:  And that is where supply chain and all of the growth capital comes in.
SPEAKER_04 [152.00-154.00]:  Once we have enough inventory, we have 1000 units.
SPEAKER_04 [154.00-155.00]:  And we have done the same thing.
SPEAKER_04 [155.00-157.00]:  Last time we had 1000 units.
SPEAKER_04 [157.00-159.00]:  We had better than 8-10 months before.
SPEAKER_04 [159.00-166.00]:  But now when we get to the end of the year, then we have to challenge ourselves a little.
SPEAKER_04 [166.00-170.00]:  Now as we speak, right now, we are out of MS02.
SPEAKER_04 [170.00-171.00]:  There is no MS02.
SPEAKER_04 [171.00-173.00]:  And about 150 units.
SPEAKER_04 [173.00-175.00]:  There are 700 units in the port.
SPEAKER_01 [175.00-176.00]:  There are 700 units in the port.
SPEAKER_01 [176.00-180.00]:  They will be released and then you need 28000 for the stuff.
SPEAKER_01 [180.00-181.00]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_01 [181.00-183.00]:  We need about 20 million for that.
SPEAKER_01 [183.00-186.00]:  We had to get 1200 units.
SPEAKER_04 [186.00-187.00]:  We got 700 units.
SPEAKER_03 [187.00-188.00]:  We got 640.
SPEAKER_03 [188.00-189.00]:  We got 20 million.
SPEAKER_03 [189.00-190.00]:  We got 640.
SPEAKER_03 [190.00-191.00]:  We got 640.
SPEAKER_03 [191.00-196.00]:  So, the 11 million that we have to clear, that is originating from that.
SPEAKER_03 [196.00-198.00]:  Which means that opening the office.
SPEAKER_03 [198.00-201.00]:  We have to clear it and then we have to close it at 28000.
SPEAKER_00 [201.00-202.00]:  Yes, I think it is 11 million.
SPEAKER_00 [202.00-203.00]:  He said 31 million.
SPEAKER_00 [203.00-205.00]:  But this problem is in front of us.
SPEAKER_00 [205.00-206.00]:  But we have to clear it.
SPEAKER_00 [206.00-207.00]:  We need 7 million.
SPEAKER_00 [207.00-208.00]:  We have to clear it.
SPEAKER_02 [208.00-210.00]:  We need 8 million for clearance.
SPEAKER_02 [210.00-211.00]:  We need 8 million.
SPEAKER_02 [211.00-212.00]:  Look, some cash flow.
SPEAKER_02 [212.00-213.00]:  Is there any left?
SPEAKER_02 [213.00-214.00]:  There is no cash flow.
SPEAKER_01 [214.00-215.00]:  38 million.
SPEAKER_04 [215.00-217.00]:  38 million is the biggest cost of My Water.
SPEAKER_04 [217.00-219.00]:  Look, there is 20 million MRC in the back, right?
SPEAKER_04 [219.00-220.00]:  And I am adding it.
SPEAKER_04 [220.00-221.00]:  I am adding it.
SPEAKER_01 [221.00-222.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_01 [222.00-223.00]:  38 million is the monthly expense of My Water with loan repayments.
SPEAKER_01 [223.00-224.00]:  38?
SPEAKER_04 [224.00-225.00]:  What is 38?
SPEAKER_04 [225.00-226.00]:  38.
SPEAKER_04 [226.00-227.00]:  38.
SPEAKER_04 [227.00-228.00]:  38.
SPEAKER_04 [228.00-229.00]:  38.
SPEAKER_04 [229.00-230.00]:  38.
SPEAKER_04 [230.00-231.00]:  38.
SPEAKER_04 [231.00-232.00]:  38.
SPEAKER_04 [232.00-233.00]:  38.
SPEAKER_04 [233.00-234.00]:  40 million.
SPEAKER_04 [234.00-235.00]:  So we have to pass the level of annual dripping.
SPEAKER_04 [235.00-236.00]:  To take credit out of this, we have to pay somebody.
SPEAKER_04 [236.00-237.00]:  This is another big thing.
SPEAKER_04 [238.00-239.00]:  So, thousand?
SPEAKER_04 [239.00-240.00]:  Woah!
SPEAKER_04 [240.00-241.00]:  See, if I add 5 million, they will give me 2 million.
SPEAKER_04 [247.00-253.00]:  In other words, you are saying this candy that I already paid.
SPEAKER_00 [253.00-254.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_00 [254.00-258.00]:  we did it, now you are breaking this up for the istח.
SPEAKER_00 [258.00-259.00]:  No, with limit.
SPEAKER_00 [259.00-260.00]:  With limit.
SPEAKER_00 [260.00-261.00]:  He is my listener.
SPEAKER_00 [261.00-267.00]:  Suppose the machine comes, then how much will be the increase in operation expense?
SPEAKER_01 [267.00-274.00]:  I was just seeing here that you have decrease in cost of services.
SPEAKER_01 [274.00-280.00]:  I want to see that the cost will remain there, the revenue will have more effect.
SPEAKER_01 [280.00-282.00]:  There will be a little difference.
SPEAKER_00 [282.00-284.00]:  There will be a little difference.
SPEAKER_01 [284.00-285.00]:  Right?
SPEAKER_03 [285.00-286.00]:  Revenue will increase.
SPEAKER_01 [286.00-293.00]:  For 2000 units, the cost will not increase, there will be no increase in cost because you already have teams.
SPEAKER_01 [293.00-294.00]:  We already have HR.
SPEAKER_01 [294.00-296.00]:  We have production capacity.
SPEAKER_04 [296.00-297.00]:  We have production capacity.
SPEAKER_04 [297.00-300.00]:  Only 2 more units will be needed for service.
SPEAKER_01 [0.00-8.00]:  The magnitude of the servicing in terms of the pricing or the cost is very minimal.
SPEAKER_01 [8.00-13.00]:  Now we have localized the PP. That is our biggest win for this year.
SPEAKER_01 [13.00-18.00]:  We have localized the first sediment filter and we have got a cost of Rs. 200.
SPEAKER_01 [18.00-19.00]:  How much was it before?
SPEAKER_01 [19.00-24.00]:  Before it was of Rs. 350. We have made the mineral of Rs. 2800 to Rs. 250.
SPEAKER_01 [24.00-27.00]:  And we have made the work of Rs. 2800 to Rs. 250.
SPEAKER_01 [27.00-29.00]:  Similarly, we have reduced the cost of QD.
SPEAKER_01 [29.00-31.00]:  So, the impact of that will be there in this budget.
SPEAKER_01 [31.00-38.00]:  If you see the cost of goods, then the impact of that has already come on the budget.
SPEAKER_01 [38.00-40.00]:  Vis-a-vis the revenue.
SPEAKER_04 [40.00-46.00]:  You are feeling that the cost of silts is high because we have sold some RO during this quarter.
SPEAKER_04 [46.00-48.00]:  But you are talking about reducing the cost.
SPEAKER_04 [48.00-54.00]:  The cost has reduced but you are seeing that the increase of 18 Institute is 41%.
SPEAKER_04 [54.00-58.00]:  One of the reasons is that we have sold some RO plants during this quarter.
SPEAKER_04 [58.00-59.00]:  That means, 15 of 18.
SPEAKER_00 [59.00-62.00]:  15 of 18, but 25 because of RO plant's increase.
SPEAKER_00 [62.00-64.00]:  Yes, that is it.
SPEAKER_01 [64.00-65.00]:  Next.
SPEAKER_00 [80.00-81.00]:  Let's go.
SPEAKER_01 [81.00-84.00]:  Okay. So, this is revenue comparison for OTC MRC and Total Revenue.
SPEAKER_01 [84.00-87.00]:  So, OTC Q1-2024 had 10 LL.
SPEAKER_01 [87.00-88.00]:  In this quarter.
SPEAKER_01 [88.00-90.40]:  This quarter it's 12 million.
SPEAKER_01 [92.00-96.20]:  Revenue increased by 22% from 50 million to 61 million.
SPEAKER_01 [96.60-98.80]:  Upfront in RO sales it was 2 million.
SPEAKER_01 [98.90-102.60]:  This quarter it's 9 million and this is another addition in our product portfolio.
SPEAKER_01 [102.90-104.10]:  So this will also grow.
SPEAKER_01 [104.50-109.40]:  And in this we have added a solace which has increased by 2 million OTC.
SPEAKER_01 [109.50-110.80]:  It's a number of solace.
SPEAKER_01 [110.90-114.00]:  That's our upcoming product that we have high hopes from.
SPEAKER_01 [114.00-116.60]:  And then the jump in total revenue is 31%.
SPEAKER_01 [116.60-120.80]:  So it was 62 million in Q1 2024 and now it's 81 million.
SPEAKER_03 [121.80-126.00]:  What is the split between 81 million and business?
SPEAKER_03 [126.20-128.70]:  Sir, there are three parameters of this.
SPEAKER_01 [128.70-131.40]:  One is if you look at it customer wise,
SPEAKER_01 [131.70-135.90]:  85% is B2C and 50% is B2B.
SPEAKER_01 [136.20-140.50]:  If you look at it revenue wise, 65% is B2C and 35% is B2B.
SPEAKER_01 [140.80-144.60]:  If you look at it units wise, 70% is B2C and 30% is B2B.
SPEAKER_03 [145.40-146.30]:  In revenue,
SPEAKER_03 [146.30-148.40]:  35% is corporate.
SPEAKER_03 [148.60-151.00]:  Yes, yes, yes, total revenue 65%.
SPEAKER_03 [151.20-153.10]:  65% is consumer.
SPEAKER_03 [153.10-157.00]:  And this is the ratio of 2-3 years.
SPEAKER_01 [157.00-159.60]:  And when we have 20,000-25,000 customers,
SPEAKER_01 [159.60-160.70]:  then this 80%
SPEAKER_01 [161.60-163.20]:  close to 80% will be B2C.
SPEAKER_01 [163.20-165.60]:  Consumer side is still increasing a little bit.
SPEAKER_04 [165.60-166.60]:  Cost per default.
SPEAKER_03 [167.20-167.70]:  Band debt.
SPEAKER_03 [169.10-169.80]:  Band debt.
SPEAKER_03 [169.80-171.70]:  Let's say 80% of the world.
SPEAKER_00 [172.60-174.10]:  Band debt if you
SPEAKER_00 [174.10-176.10]:  look at the percentage,
SPEAKER_00 [176.10-178.10]:  Actually, the bad debt that I am seeing,
SPEAKER_00 [178.10-182.10]:  their bad debt is 24-25.
SPEAKER_00 [183.20-186.10]:  21, 22, 23, these three years,
SPEAKER_00 [186.60-187.80]:  for whatever reasons,
SPEAKER_00 [188.20-191.20]:  the way it is sold, the commitment it has sold,
SPEAKER_00 [191.50-193.20]:  we have a huge amount of bad debt.
SPEAKER_00 [193.20-195.20]:  They have a 2-year debt.
SPEAKER_02 [196.40-197.90]:  But did the machines recover?
SPEAKER_02 [198.50-200.30]:  Machines recovered at some places.
SPEAKER_04 [200.30-201.40]:  Majority of the machines.
SPEAKER_04 [201.40-203.40]:  Out of about 1100 machines,
SPEAKER_00 [203.40-204.90]:  there were 750-800 machines.
SPEAKER_00 [204.90-205.90]:  Majority recovered.
SPEAKER_04 [206.40-208.40]:  What are they doing?
SPEAKER_02 [208.90-210.90]:  They are not for them.
SPEAKER_00 [210.90-212.40]:  People are doing it for fun.
SPEAKER_00 [212.40-213.40]:  But we did this.
SPEAKER_00 [213.40-214.90]:  They did this in My Water.
SPEAKER_00 [215.40-216.40]:  These machines recovered
SPEAKER_00 [216.40-217.90]:  because they have the refurbishing.
SPEAKER_00 [217.90-219.40]:  They recommissioned again.
SPEAKER_00 [219.40-220.40]:  Yes, yes, that's right.
SPEAKER_00 [220.40-220.90]:  Excellent.
SPEAKER_02 [221.40-223.40]:  This is interesting.
SPEAKER_01 [225.40-226.90]:  Some customers from that
SPEAKER_01 [227.40-228.40]:  open it
SPEAKER_01 [229.10-231.10]:  they try to tinker with the machine.
SPEAKER_01 [231.10-233.30]:  Some customers say they filter from the market.
SPEAKER_01 [233.40-235.40]:  I don't know which filter they take.
SPEAKER_01 [235.90-238.90]:  Secondly, when we initially started selling it,
SPEAKER_01 [238.90-240.90]:  we promised the customers about the ownership.
SPEAKER_01 [240.90-242.90]:  Now, as Mr. Adnan said,
SPEAKER_01 [242.90-244.90]:  the ownership was around 1200 cases.
SPEAKER_01 [245.40-246.40]:  We resolved around
SPEAKER_01 [246.90-249.40]:  close to 900, more than 900 cases.
SPEAKER_01 [249.40-251.40]:  When we increased the revenue,
SPEAKER_01 [251.40-253.40]:  we said, take ownership.
SPEAKER_01 [253.40-255.40]:  We told some customers to take ownership.
SPEAKER_01 [255.40-257.40]:  But keep on giving us the MRC.
SPEAKER_01 [257.90-258.90]:  But even then,
SPEAKER_01 [258.90-261.90]:  the number of 200-250 is still pending,
SPEAKER_01 [261.90-262.40]:  which
SPEAKER_01 [262.40-263.40]:  is still pending.
SPEAKER_01 [263.40-265.40]:  So, what is the bed debt of 2024?
SPEAKER_03 [265.40-268.40]:  The bed debt number is around
SPEAKER_04 [268.40-270.40]:  our monthly
SPEAKER_04 [270.40-273.40]:  7-8 lakhs per month.
SPEAKER_04 [273.40-276.40]:  Which is about 20 billion MRC.
SPEAKER_03 [276.40-280.40]:  8 lakhs out of 28 billion MRC.
SPEAKER_03 [280.40-281.40]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_03 [281.40-284.40]:  If 3500 rupees are allocated,
SPEAKER_03 [284.40-290.40]:  then how much is the machine at 7 lakhs?
SPEAKER_02 [292.40-294.40]:  7 lakhs divided by 3500.
SPEAKER_02 [294.40-297.40]:  How much is it?
SPEAKER_02 [297.40-298.40]:  200.
SPEAKER_02 [298.40-299.40]:  200 machines.
SPEAKER_02 [30.00-35.00]:  It is a big number. It is 4-5% total number of machines.
SPEAKER_00 [35.00-39.00]:  In 5400, no machine is coming.
SPEAKER_02 [39.00-41.00]:  If I talk about revenue, 30 million.
SPEAKER_02 [41.00-43.00]:  This is what customers carry forward.
SPEAKER_00 [43.00-46.00]:  19, 20, 21, 22 lakhs.
SPEAKER_00 [46.00-50.00]:  This is the customer who was sold Terra MS01.
SPEAKER_00 [50.00-55.00]:  We had promised them that after 3 years, your MRC will come to the motor ship and your MRC will be half.
SPEAKER_00 [55.00-60.00]:  3.5. 200 divided by 5.
SPEAKER_02 [60.00-62.00]:  You have promised.
SPEAKER_00 [62.00-64.00]:  In terms of number of units.
SPEAKER_00 [64.00-66.00]:  Most of the units.
SPEAKER_00 [66.00-69.00]:  But you have resolved that it will be 200-200.
SPEAKER_00 [69.00-71.00]:  Every month.
SPEAKER_00 [71.00-73.00]:  There are three.
SPEAKER_01 [73.00-76.00]:  These are not new customers.
SPEAKER_01 [76.00-78.00]:  These are the same customers.
SPEAKER_01 [78.00-83.00]:  I think there are three sets of conversations going on over here.
SPEAKER_01 [83.00-85.00]:  I think let's narrow them down.
SPEAKER_01 [85.00-86.00]:  One by one.
SPEAKER_01 [86.00-88.00]:  Question is what is your churn?
SPEAKER_01 [88.00-90.00]:  Monthly churn.
SPEAKER_01 [90.00-93.00]:  And is that an acceptable churn for this business that you are doing?
SPEAKER_01 [93.00-95.00]:  And how you are recovering that?
SPEAKER_01 [95.00-97.00]:  Because churn is so important.
SPEAKER_01 [97.00-99.00]:  Because you are spending a lot of money.
SPEAKER_01 [99.00-100.00]:  And how you do.
SPEAKER_01 [100.00-103.00]:  Is the churn happening after 26 months?
SPEAKER_01 [103.00-105.00]:  Or in the third month?
SPEAKER_01 [105.00-106.00]:  Or in the third month?
SPEAKER_01 [106.00-109.00]:  That is the analysis that is important to understand.
SPEAKER_01 [109.00-112.00]:  Because some money will be recovered or not.
SPEAKER_01 [112.00-114.00]:  So it is not as simple as one straight line.
SPEAKER_01 [114.00-115.00]:  That is the analysis.
SPEAKER_01 [115.00-119.00]:  The second thing is that churn is one thing for dissatisfaction.
SPEAKER_01 [119.00-122.00]:  And then churn like in our consumer,
SPEAKER_01 [122.00-123.00]:  whatever it is,
SPEAKER_01 [123.00-125.00]:  that is very less relocation.
SPEAKER_00 [125.00-127.00]:  In the case of shifting,
SPEAKER_00 [127.00-129.00]:  our shifting is very less.
SPEAKER_01 [129.00-130.00]:  In my waterway,
SPEAKER_01 [130.00-132.00]:  my shifting cases are very less.
SPEAKER_01 [132.00-133.00]:  It will be on the moment.
SPEAKER_02 [133.00-134.00]:  It will be on the day of arrival.
SPEAKER_02 [134.00-137.00]:  This is shifting is at number two actually.
SPEAKER_00 [137.00-140.00]:  Non-payment and shifting decommissions.
SPEAKER_00 [140.00-142.00]:  Number one is non-payment.
SPEAKER_00 [142.00-144.00]:  Shifting, moving out of station.
SPEAKER_00 [144.00-146.00]:  What does that mean?
SPEAKER_00 [146.00-148.00]:  A lot of our customers move abroad.
SPEAKER_02 [148.00-149.00]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_02 [149.00-151.00]:  A lot of customers move abroad.
SPEAKER_01 [151.00-153.00]:  Now here is what is happening.
SPEAKER_01 [153.00-155.00]:  Our shifting is not abroad.
SPEAKER_00 [155.00-156.00]:  Our shifting is very much.
SPEAKER_01 [156.00-158.00]:  I think it is important.
SPEAKER_01 [158.00-161.00]:  I think these are very very valid concerns and questions.
SPEAKER_01 [161.00-163.00]:  So this unit which is costing us,
SPEAKER_01 [163.00-166.00]:  costing My Water 90-95,000 rupees.
SPEAKER_01 [166.00-171.00]:  They have done its OTC of 40,000 rupees.
SPEAKER_01 [171.00-173.00]:  So you have to recover 55,000 rupees.
SPEAKER_01 [173.00-176.00]:  From a customer over a period of
SPEAKER_01 [176.00-179.00]:  2000 to 24-25 months.
SPEAKER_01 [179.00-182.00]:  So that is another category which is paying.
SPEAKER_01 [182.00-185.00]:  Suppose you pay for 12 months and say to shift.
SPEAKER_01 [185.00-187.00]:  Originally, it was that this ownership
SPEAKER_01 [187.00-189.00]:  whose fight is to be told,
SPEAKER_01 [189.00-191.00]:  it was a understanding that
SPEAKER_01 [191.00-195.00]:  if my disconnect is also due to non-payment,
SPEAKER_01 [195.00-197.00]:  then the unit is ours.
SPEAKER_01 [197.00-198.00]:  In five years?
SPEAKER_01 [198.00-199.00]:  In five years.
SPEAKER_01 [199.00-201.00]:  No, no, it is ours from the first day.
SPEAKER_01 [201.00-202.00]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_01 [202.00-204.00]:  So they have not decided to return.
SPEAKER_01 [204.00-206.00]:  So that 200 people are left.
SPEAKER_01 [206.00-209.00]:  But wherever they have a rise.
SPEAKER_01 [209.00-212.00]:  This is something logically need to understand.
SPEAKER_01 [212.00-215.00]:  Suppose people, 70-80, whatever people have a rise,
SPEAKER_01 [215.00-217.00]:  then they say okay, I can't afford it.
SPEAKER_01 [217.00-218.00]:  Or I don't like water.
SPEAKER_01 [218.00-220.00]:  Or I am going abroad.
SPEAKER_01 [220.00-221.00]:  So they pick up the machine.
SPEAKER_01 [221.00-222.00]:  Yes, sir.
SPEAKER_01 [222.00-224.00]:  By picking up this machine,
SPEAKER_01 [224.00-226.00]:  they put 7000 to 7000 on it.
SPEAKER_00 [226.00-227.00]:  Sometimes lower.
SPEAKER_00 [227.00-230.00]:  By putting 6 to 7000, then they sell it for 40,000 again.
SPEAKER_01 [230.00-231.00]:  Then they sell it for 40,000.
SPEAKER_01 [231.00-238.00]:  So in that sense, they recover within that amount.
SPEAKER_01 [238.00-240.00]:  Whatever effort, then you have a new client.
SPEAKER_01 [240.00-245.00]:  Now, earlier it was that they had less clients and units.
SPEAKER_01 [245.00-246.00]:  Now they have this position.
SPEAKER_01 [246.00-248.00]:  They are in a healthier situation.
SPEAKER_01 [248.00-251.00]:  People forgot to remind Ali, I guess.
SPEAKER_01 [251.00-252.00]:  I said,
SPEAKER_01 [252.00-253.00]:  I have a question.
SPEAKER_01 [253.00-254.00]:  Yes, sir.
SPEAKER_01 [254.00-255.00]:  Is Ali there?
SPEAKER_01 [255.00-256.00]:  Ali is here.
SPEAKER_01 [256.00-257.00]:  Ali is here.
SPEAKER_01 [257.00-258.00]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_01 [258.00-259.00]:  You sit close to me.
SPEAKER_01 [259.00-260.00]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_01 [260.00-267.00]:  So, now they are in a situation where they have sold 200
SPEAKER_01 [267.00-271.00]:  and they have only 160 machines to install.
SPEAKER_01 [271.00-274.00]:  In that, the churned ones immediately recover.
SPEAKER_01 [274.00-275.00]:  So, that's one part.
SPEAKER_01 [275.00-279.00]:  I think the churn that we need to be worried about is,
SPEAKER_01 [279.00-281.00]:  I mean, effect of the churn.
SPEAKER_01 [281.00-283.00]:  I am not saying it in simple numbers.
SPEAKER_01 [283.00-287.00]:  I think we need to be aware of how much of them do because of quality of service.
SPEAKER_01 [287.00-288.00]:  I think that is the...
SPEAKER_01 [288.00-289.00]:  And within a year.
SPEAKER_01 [289.00-290.00]:  Quality of service.
SPEAKER_01 [290.00-291.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_01 [291.00-292.00]:  Quality of service.
SPEAKER_01 [292.00-295.00]:  So, I think that is a number that is important for all of us to know.
SPEAKER_01 [295.00-300.00]:  But how much of that is happening since the last one year since I have got, you know,
SPEAKER_03 [0.00-4.80]:  US what do you call it? My service. My care. My care.
SPEAKER_03 [4.80-8.80]:  One more thing, why don't you buy back the 200 machines that are stuck?
SPEAKER_01 [8.80-13.30]:  For example, you tell them that you will sell it for 40,000 by putting 7,000.
SPEAKER_01 [13.30-17.30]:  You tell me that brother, give me a machine for 10,000, it is of no use to you.
SPEAKER_01 [17.30-22.00]:  There are options to buy back, and from this, we have made customers
SPEAKER_00 [22.00-26.90]:  that you keep the machine. Take the whole ship. And if you are paying
SPEAKER_00 [26.90-31.40]:  3,000, we are willing to give you 1500. You do MRC half.
SPEAKER_00 [31.40-34.90]:  This is how it is done. Now, these friends are stuck, some customers
SPEAKER_00 [34.90-37.40]:  left the machine and came, they did not sell it to anyone.
SPEAKER_00 [37.40-41.40]:  Someone gave a house on rent, the tenant who came behind,
SPEAKER_00 [41.40-45.40]:  he did not know where the machine is. Is this revenue of OTC
SPEAKER_00 [45.40-50.40]:  to sell the machine? No, one time. This is the revenue of upfront and RO sales
SPEAKER_02 [50.40-54.90]:  is included in it. We do not sell machines.
SPEAKER_03 [54.90-56.40]:  We sell very little.
SPEAKER_02 [56.40-60.90]:  In it, upfront and RO, upfront sales, we call it, the machines that are sold.
SPEAKER_02 [60.90-65.40]:  I am talking about the upper one. That is the same cost. That is your 40,000, 45,000.
SPEAKER_02 [65.40-68.90]:  We don't sell machines. We lease out machines. This is also understood.
SPEAKER_03 [68.90-72.40]:  I think the finance team sitting here, we only lease machines.
SPEAKER_03 [72.40-76.90]:  There are exceptions where somebody says that you take 90,000 from them.
SPEAKER_03 [76.90-81.40]:  Okay, but we also keep the machine in a sort of leasing arrangement.
SPEAKER_03 [81.40-84.40]:  We keep it in 200 rupees because we lease machines.
SPEAKER_03 [84.40-86.40]:  Because we lease machines.
SPEAKER_03 [86.40-89.40]:  Because we want to keep the machines. Because the experience we have,
SPEAKER_03 [89.40-93.40]:  we think that the previous people owned it. We also say that if we want,
SPEAKER_03 [93.40-95.40]:  we used to say for the first three years, we say that we will go for five years.
SPEAKER_03 [95.40-99.40]:  And even after five years, if we want to replace the machine, we will replace it.
SPEAKER_03 [99.40-102.40]:  And we will take the cost per one time from them. 50% or 100%.
SPEAKER_03 [102.40-106.40]:  We have two revenue models. One revenue model, we have kept the margin
SPEAKER_03 [106.40-111.40]:  above leasing to be able to, whatever the cost of kybor plus 20%.
SPEAKER_03 [111.40-116.40]:  We are keeping 20% profit. Yes, so leasing is going on kybor plus 20%.
SPEAKER_03 [116.40-122.40]:  And the service business is different. If it is of 4000, then it is 2000 and 2000.
SPEAKER_03 [122.40-126.40]:  So in 2000, we have kybor plus 20% going on here.
SPEAKER_03 [126.40-131.40]:  And that is revenue by OTC. It is that plus 20.
SPEAKER_00 [131.40-134.40]:  This portion goes in that.
SPEAKER_02 [134.40-140.40]:  It is booked in that. Look, if first, okay, coming addressing that.
SPEAKER_03 [140.40-144.40]:  If first you take 95,000 rupees or 100,000 rupees, we took 40,000.
SPEAKER_03 [144.40-145.40]:  Now that 60,000. Yes.
SPEAKER_03 [145.40-149.40]:  Now that 60,000 that we have to take, that service will come in kistos.
SPEAKER_03 [149.40-152.40]:  On that, we have kybor plus 20%. Absolutely.
SPEAKER_03 [152.40-155.40]:  And 40,000 is this. This is 40,000.
SPEAKER_03 [155.40-156.40]:  This is 40,000. This is 40,000.
SPEAKER_00 [156.40-158.40]:  Partial. Yes. Yes.
SPEAKER_00 [158.40-159.40]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_00 [159.40-163.40]:  What do you do with the cost of the machine?
SPEAKER_00 [163.40-166.40]:  If you charge 40% cost, then the cost of wood sole is there or not?
SPEAKER_00 [166.40-167.40]:  No. No.
SPEAKER_00 [167.40-169.40]:  We have capitalized it. We have capitalized it.
SPEAKER_02 [169.40-172.40]:  We are depreciating it. Whenever depreciation is coming, we are depreciating it for 15 million.
SPEAKER_01 [172.40-173.40]:  And our asset is also the same.
SPEAKER_01 [173.40-174.40]:  The machine is also the same.
SPEAKER_03 [175.40-177.40]:  When it comes in the book, then our asset.
SPEAKER_02 [177.40-181.40]:  If we sell upfront, then it happens in upfront, for example, our machine is worth lakhs.
SPEAKER_02 [181.40-184.40]:  Someone says that upfront this machine is possible.
SPEAKER_02 [184.40-186.40]:  We sell it for 2 lakhs, 1.5 lakhs.
SPEAKER_02 [186.40-189.40]:  In that case, we have to charge the full cost of it.
SPEAKER_02 [189.40-192.40]:  No. No. We sell it in half.
SPEAKER_03 [192.40-193.40]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_03 [193.40-195.40]:  We take MRCP of 3 years.
SPEAKER_03 [195.40-196.40]:  MRCP is also covered.
SPEAKER_03 [196.40-197.40]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_04 [197.40-198.40]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_04 [198.40-201.40]:  My sir, I request you to participate in the workshop.
SPEAKER_04 [205.40-218.40]:  My sir, the question is that the financial impact of the furniture, the device rate, the machine rate, the balance rate, whatever the impact is based on the last 2 years' time.
SPEAKER_04 [218.40-221.40]:  You know, there is a provision in the budget.
SPEAKER_04 [221.40-223.40]:  Because the needs and money are coming less in the budget.
SPEAKER_04 [223.40-228.40]:  Let's say if you have 8 lakhs in the month, it has become a year's loss.
SPEAKER_04 [228.40-233.40]:  What is the profit in our budget?
SPEAKER_04 [233.40-235.40]:  In the budget, we have 1 million.
SPEAKER_04 [235.40-238.40]:  In the consumer business, generally, we overlook it.
SPEAKER_04 [238.40-240.40]:  No. No. We have covered it.
SPEAKER_02 [240.40-243.40]:  We have kept it close to 1 million per month.
SPEAKER_02 [243.40-246.40]:  Sir, is there a separate line of Vendat in P&L?
SPEAKER_02 [246.40-247.40]:  It is not in this report.
SPEAKER_02 [247.40-250.40]:  It is in our internal report.
SPEAKER_02 [250.40-251.40]:  This is the other item.
SPEAKER_02 [251.40-252.40]:  This is the other item.
SPEAKER_02 [252.40-255.40]:  I think that Vendat has a separate line item.
SPEAKER_00 [255.40-256.40]:  No. No.
SPEAKER_03 [256.40-258.40]:  It should be in this.
SPEAKER_03 [258.40-260.40]:  In this, just for information over here.
SPEAKER_03 [260.40-261.40]:  Its Vendat is 20 to 25.
SPEAKER_03 [261.40-262.40]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_03 [262.40-264.40]:  It is 20 to 22.
SPEAKER_03 [264.40-267.40]:  Then, of course, we have to go to the banks also.
SPEAKER_03 [267.40-268.40]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_03 [268.40-269.40]:  And we have to give them the number.
SPEAKER_03 [269.40-272.40]:  Then, I personally bought out some of that debt.
SPEAKER_03 [272.40-274.40]:  To be able to, for the banks.
SPEAKER_03 [274.40-279.40]:  Clearly, at 30 to 40 million, I bought out that debt to be able to.
SPEAKER_02 [279.40-281.40]:  Actually, we are stuck there also.
SPEAKER_02 [281.40-282.40]:  We cannot write off also.
SPEAKER_02 [282.40-284.40]:  The loss will be hit.
SPEAKER_02 [284.40-288.40]:  And we cannot transfer here also because our current assets will be reduced.
SPEAKER_02 [288.40-290.40]:  If the current assets will be reduced, the current ratio will be changed.
SPEAKER_02 [290.40-291.40]:  And the revenue will not be reduced.
SPEAKER_03 [292.40-293.40]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_03 [293.40-295.40]:  We are stuck like this.
SPEAKER_03 [295.40-298.40]:  So, 84% of our income is in this rate.
SPEAKER_03 [298.40-299.40]:  0.8.
SPEAKER_03 [299.40-300.40]:  0.8.
SPEAKER_00 [0.00-8.00]:  I said maintain it between 8 and 9. Then we make a decision after the next set of disbursements.
SPEAKER_01 [8.00-17.00]:  If it reaches 1.5-2 million, then I will have to buy out some more debt to be able to settle that.
SPEAKER_01 [17.00-21.00]:  As in putting in equity, I would rather do that in a reverse.
SPEAKER_01 [21.00-28.00]:  Because there is no other way, otherwise until they cross 10,000, their books will not allow them to be able to do it.
SPEAKER_01 [28.00-32.00]:  I hope they are doing the right thing to do that.
SPEAKER_01 [32.00-35.00]:  Is this the answer? Yes.
SPEAKER_00 [35.00-38.00]:  This is a break of current ratio.
SPEAKER_00 [38.00-41.00]:  I am talking about internal reporting.
SPEAKER_00 [41.00-43.00]:  Internal reporting is more important.
SPEAKER_01 [43.00-45.00]:  I am just saying.
SPEAKER_02 [45.00-53.00]:  Sir, I would like to say that our colleagues who are running companies and departments,
SPEAKER_02 [53.00-57.00]:  and upcoming CEOs will also be coming out of this company.
SPEAKER_02 [57.00-58.00]:  I would like to say that
SPEAKER_02 [58.00-60.00]:  Sir, I would like to add one thing to your learning.
SPEAKER_02 [60.00-63.00]:  Zaheer, Kamran, Danish, are you hearing me?
SPEAKER_02 [63.00-64.00]:  Yes, I am hearing you.
SPEAKER_02 [64.00-69.00]:  Sir, I would like to say that in 2022-23, our bandit was more.
SPEAKER_02 [69.00-71.00]:  That time when My Water was launched.
SPEAKER_02 [71.00-79.00]:  Generally, in startups, we do not run things in a structured way in the execution phase.
SPEAKER_02 [79.00-82.00]:  So we have to keep this in mind.
SPEAKER_02 [82.00-84.00]:  Zaheer, are you listening to what I am saying?
SPEAKER_02 [84.00-85.00]:  Yes, boss.
SPEAKER_02 [85.00-86.00]:  Very important.
SPEAKER_02 [86.00-87.00]:  Look, on the foundation layer,
SPEAKER_02 [87.00-91.00]:  strategy is sales, business strategy is market.
SPEAKER_02 [91.00-94.00]:  You see how big and small the market is.
SPEAKER_02 [94.00-99.00]:  Procedure should also be brought in every company, especially from day one,
SPEAKER_02 [99.00-101.00]:  from financial governance.
SPEAKER_02 [101.00-102.00]:  Otherwise, you will be in trouble.
SPEAKER_02 [102.00-105.00]:  We had a problem in Al-Gusaira as well.
SPEAKER_02 [105.00-106.00]:  Our growth was so fast.
SPEAKER_02 [106.00-107.00]:  Zaheer, do you remember?
SPEAKER_02 [107.00-108.00]:  Yes, I remember.
SPEAKER_02 [108.00-111.00]:  When we had 300 riders suddenly, we had a problem.
SPEAKER_02 [111.00-113.00]:  But Alhamdulillah, we survived.
SPEAKER_02 [113.00-115.00]:  With Zaheer and his team effort.
SPEAKER_02 [115.00-118.00]:  But when we come here, we should be mindful.
SPEAKER_02 [118.00-129.00]:  Especially in startups, once we do the new things, we should make the process, procedure, governance in our company from day one.
SPEAKER_02 [129.00-131.00]:  Otherwise, we will remain in the problem.
SPEAKER_02 [131.00-135.00]:  You and Kamran are kicking Rushmore in the UAE market.
SPEAKER_02 [135.00-136.00]:  Be mindful.
SPEAKER_02 [136.00-139.00]:  Who are you working with?
SPEAKER_02 [139.00-140.00]:  Who are you working with?
SPEAKER_02 [140.00-142.00]:  What is the clientele?
SPEAKER_02 [142.00-143.00]:  What are the chances of money sinking?
SPEAKER_02 [143.00-144.00]:  What are the chances?
SPEAKER_02 [144.00-147.00]:  At least, keep this in mind critically.
SPEAKER_02 [147.00-148.00]:  Then take the decision.
SPEAKER_02 [148.00-150.00]:  I am not saying that you should not take the decision.
SPEAKER_02 [150.00-153.00]:  But critically, we should not forget this aspect.
SPEAKER_02 [153.00-154.00]:  We should not miss.
SPEAKER_02 [154.00-162.00]:  I remember, in Pakistan, Broadband came, Y-Tribe and they brought the consumer for the first time.
SPEAKER_02 [162.00-163.00]:  What did they bring?
SPEAKER_02 [163.00-164.00]:  What did Mobiling bring?
SPEAKER_02 [164.00-165.00]:  Y-Max.
SPEAKER_02 [165.00-166.00]:  Y-Max.
SPEAKER_02 [166.00-167.00]:  Vateen.
SPEAKER_02 [167.00-168.00]:  Vateen.
SPEAKER_02 [168.00-169.00]:  Vateen brought Y-Max and Mobiling.
SPEAKER_02 [169.00-170.00]:  What was the end disaster of Mobiling?
SPEAKER_02 [170.00-172.00]:  Devices were selling in the market in the southern.
SPEAKER_02 [172.00-175.00]:  The company put it in books on leasing.
SPEAKER_02 [175.00-177.00]:  Customers were given on loan.
SPEAKER_02 [177.00-180.00]:  Y-Tribe girls were selling devices in the market.
SPEAKER_02 [180.00-182.00]:  Everyone must have observed this.
SPEAKER_02 [182.00-183.00]:  Now only.
SPEAKER_02 [183.00-184.00]:  When this happens, it is a disaster.
SPEAKER_02 [184.00-185.00]:  What happened?
SPEAKER_02 [185.00-186.00]:  Y-Max closed.
SPEAKER_02 [186.00-187.00]:  Vateen closed.
SPEAKER_02 [187.00-189.00]:  Jai closed.
SPEAKER_02 [189.00-190.00]:  Vateen closed.
SPEAKER_02 [190.00-191.00]:  Y-Tribe.
SPEAKER_02 [191.00-193.00]:  And they ran away from here.
SPEAKER_02 [193.00-194.00]:  Y-Tribe was in Qatar.
SPEAKER_02 [194.00-195.00]:  They ran away.
SPEAKER_02 [195.00-201.00]:  So, this should be in our consideration while we do any kind of new business.
SPEAKER_02 [201.00-202.00]:  So, this is a big question.
SPEAKER_02 [202.00-210.00]:  The relevance in this discussion, which they just told, by Baizad, the relevance is only
SPEAKER_01 [210.00-212.00]:  on Optics and MyWater.
SPEAKER_01 [212.00-215.00]:  Because they are purely consumer.
SPEAKER_01 [215.00-218.00]:  The one who is working in Zaheer is also B2B.
SPEAKER_01 [218.00-222.00]:  I mean, the relationship is a B2B relationship.
SPEAKER_01 [222.00-226.00]:  The one who is doing Infinity is definitely on cash on delivery.
SPEAKER_01 [226.00-229.00]:  That is, on advance cash.
SPEAKER_01 [229.00-235.00]:  So, Optics has their recovery, even though they have a churn of 2-3%, but then next month
SPEAKER_01 [235.00-236.00]:  you will see.
SPEAKER_00 [236.00-237.00]:  We will get the refund.
SPEAKER_00 [237.00-238.00]:  We will take the first round.
SPEAKER_00 [238.00-239.00]:  So, they will do it.
SPEAKER_00 [239.00-240.00]:  This work.
SPEAKER_00 [240.00-242.00]:  The second ONT and box is always ours.
SPEAKER_00 [242.00-248.00]:  Now, it happened that for the first three years, MyWater did not have the capability
SPEAKER_01 [248.00-250.00]:  of turning off and on.
SPEAKER_01 [250.00-255.00]:  So, now after our version 3, when it started, it has started now.
SPEAKER_01 [255.00-258.00]:  Shahrukh and Amar, both of them, the team, they have now worked on it.
SPEAKER_01 [258.00-260.00]:  They have now worked hard to be able to do it.
SPEAKER_01 [260.00-271.00]:  I think MyWater is at least a year away before they can convince me that they will be at
SPEAKER_01 [271.00-274.00]:  99% recovery on an annual basis.
SPEAKER_01 [274.00-278.00]:  They are probably between 94% to 95% right now.
SPEAKER_01 [278.00-279.00]:  I don't know exactly what it is.
SPEAKER_01 [279.00-285.00]:  But consumer business, I agree with Bawa that until they don't have 99% plus recovery
SPEAKER_01 [285.00-287.00]:  month on month, especially that you are going on the consumer side.
SPEAKER_01 [287.00-289.00]:  You are going to definitely face things.
SPEAKER_01 [289.00-292.00]:  Sir, the relevance in Algoosehra was not the revenue side.
SPEAKER_01 [292.00-293.00]:  It was something else.
SPEAKER_01 [293.00-300.00]:  That's why we need to see the entire 360 degree of the business.
SPEAKER_03 [0.00-5.00]:  What is our challenge there? We gave our rider an asset.
SPEAKER_03 [5.00-11.00]:  The cost of the asset is 8000 Dharams. We gave the rider a loan.
SPEAKER_03 [11.00-19.00]:  We gave him a loan. We also invested 10-15000 Dharams for the rider.
SPEAKER_03 [19.00-24.00]:  The supporting paper of this is more refined, legal and all the rest we can do.
SPEAKER_03 [24.00-31.00]:  We improved the paperwork there. If someone takes money from us and does the asset,
SPEAKER_03 [31.00-35.00]:  if there is an IoT device in the bike, we can track where the bike went.
SPEAKER_03 [35.00-41.00]:  We used to steal the bike and take it. We used to ride it. We used to take loans and run away.
SPEAKER_03 [41.00-43.00]:  That is also a default.
SPEAKER_03 [43.00-49.00]:  What we did was that Zaheer and his team brought legal aspects in it.
SPEAKER_03 [49.00-53.00]:  Agreement, cover. Someone said that the sign will not work, you have to put a thumb.
SPEAKER_03 [53.00-54.00]:  The thumb is not working.
SPEAKER_03 [54.00-57.00]:  We put a thumb in it, gave his passport. All these processes.
SPEAKER_03 [57.00-60.00]:  We are in the place to make sure that our things are done.
SPEAKER_03 [60.00-62.00]:  Video recording was done.
SPEAKER_03 [62.00-65.00]:  Video recording was done, sir. That they are giving you a loan.
SPEAKER_03 [65.00-68.00]:  The lawyer said that video will be recorded.
SPEAKER_03 [68.00-70.00]:  That this transaction is done.
SPEAKER_03 [70.00-73.00]:  So that system was done. Otherwise we were stuck.
SPEAKER_03 [73.00-76.00]:  We were not knowing the record of the bikes.
SPEAKER_03 [76.00-78.00]:  AC bought the bike. AC quietly bought the bike.
SPEAKER_03 [78.00-79.00]:  Gave it to Arsalan.
SPEAKER_03 [79.00-80.00]:  What?
SPEAKER_03 [80.00-81.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_03 [81.00-83.00]:  You are a rider and you are giving it to Arsalan.
SPEAKER_02 [83.00-85.00]:  That is a challenge.
SPEAKER_01 [85.00-88.00]:  We have to bring the control.
SPEAKER_01 [88.00-90.00]:  How are we doing in this segment?
SPEAKER_03 [90.00-91.00]:  Yeah.
SPEAKER_01 [91.00-96.00]:  So, B2B and B2C breakup is as follows.
SPEAKER_01 [96.00-104.00]:  Like I said, total customers, B2C's 84% is consumers and businesses are 10 in 1.
SPEAKER_01 [104.00-106.00]:  Is it increasing or decreasing?
SPEAKER_01 [106.00-108.00]:  It is increasing with the same ratio.
SPEAKER_01 [108.00-111.00]:  But when we are at 20,000 units,
SPEAKER_01 [111.00-112.00]:  20,000 units,
SPEAKER_01 [112.00-120.00]:  then our revenue, the revenue will be close to 80% coming from B2C.
SPEAKER_03 [120.00-122.00]:  Is it still 34%?
SPEAKER_03 [122.00-123.00]:  No, it is low.
SPEAKER_03 [123.00-124.00]:  No, it is just revenue.
SPEAKER_03 [124.00-125.00]:  Okay, point number 3.
SPEAKER_02 [125.00-127.00]:  I don't know.
SPEAKER_02 [127.00-132.00]:  Because if your solace kicks in.
SPEAKER_02 [132.00-134.00]:  No, but Arpu is better.
SPEAKER_01 [134.00-136.00]:  Arpu is not very good in business.
SPEAKER_01 [136.00-139.00]:  It is MA03 and solace is applied there.
SPEAKER_01 [139.00-141.00]:  We sell MA03 at 6000.
SPEAKER_01 [141.00-143.00]:  But there is no MA03.
SPEAKER_01 [143.00-149.00]:  I am saying that if Arpu is better, there should not be much pressure in this direction.
SPEAKER_01 [149.00-152.00]:  Look, in B2B, we have a lot of decommission.
SPEAKER_01 [152.00-155.00]:  Okay, because of the quality, because of the taste.
SPEAKER_01 [155.00-158.00]:  There is a strange psychological phenomenon which goes on.
SPEAKER_01 [158.00-161.00]:  So, there is a company of 100 people, 200 people.
SPEAKER_01 [161.00-167.00]:  Out of them, if any one of them comes out of rumor, that this water is not tasty, this water is not right.
SPEAKER_01 [167.00-169.00]:  For example, just to give you an example.
SPEAKER_01 [169.00-173.00]:  We got to hear a voice that they give distilled water, my water water.
SPEAKER_01 [173.00-176.00]:  There was a noise in the company that they are giving distilled water.
SPEAKER_01 [176.00-179.00]:  Now this is starting to happen on their internet.
SPEAKER_01 [179.00-181.00]:  In this, in your opinion?
SPEAKER_02 [181.00-182.00]:  In the building.
SPEAKER_02 [182.00-183.00]:  In the building.
SPEAKER_01 [183.00-186.00]:  In Bateen, we installed 21 units.
SPEAKER_01 [186.00-190.00]:  Right from the CEO to the bottom.
SPEAKER_01 [190.00-195.00]:  After installing the units, they said after two weeks, they will give us the sewage water.
SPEAKER_01 [195.00-198.00]:  The entire 21 units will be decommissioned in three weeks.
SPEAKER_01 [198.00-202.00]:  And they said we have no valid reason except for people are just not willing to use it.
SPEAKER_01 [202.00-205.00]:  So, there is a downside in B2B.
SPEAKER_01 [205.00-208.00]:  This is part of the business that we have lived with.
SPEAKER_01 [208.00-210.00]:  There are a lot of decommissions.
SPEAKER_01 [210.00-215.00]:  But our business is an out-and-out consumer business.
SPEAKER_01 [215.00-220.00]:  That's where this company will go, will do an IPO.
SPEAKER_01 [220.00-223.00]:  Today, it is on the B2C side.
SPEAKER_01 [223.00-225.00]:  So, we have to keep our focus.
SPEAKER_01 [225.00-227.00]:  While B2B will continue to grow with our product.
SPEAKER_01 [227.00-229.00]:  B2C is the game.
SPEAKER_01 [229.00-231.00]:  And that will keep us on the toes as well.
SPEAKER_01 [231.00-233.00]:  Because B2C's dynamics are something else.
SPEAKER_01 [233.00-238.00]:  Sir, what are the quality complaints that come with this?
SPEAKER_00 [238.00-240.00]:  What are the major products and services?
SPEAKER_00 [240.00-241.00]:  Is it taste?
SPEAKER_00 [241.00-242.00]:  It is taste.
SPEAKER_00 [242.00-243.00]:  It is smell.
SPEAKER_00 [243.00-245.00]:  That initially happens.
SPEAKER_00 [245.00-246.00]:  It doesn't happen after that.
SPEAKER_00 [246.00-247.00]:  Why does it start?
SPEAKER_00 [247.00-249.00]:  It takes 5 years.
SPEAKER_00 [249.00-250.00]:  Why does it start?
SPEAKER_00 [250.00-253.00]:  Now, the customer, see our cycle.
SPEAKER_01 [253.00-255.00]:  Usually, we visit once a quarter.
SPEAKER_01 [255.00-256.00]:  So, in the last six months,
SPEAKER_01 [256.00-258.00]:  we have reduced the complaints a lot.
SPEAKER_01 [258.00-260.00]:  Sometimes, when we run out of stock,
SPEAKER_01 [260.00-262.00]:  especially on the BP and CTO side,
SPEAKER_01 [262.00-265.00]:  we have to procure local BPO, local CTO.
SPEAKER_01 [265.00-270.00]:  In that, there are some cases where the customer says that there is some smell or some taste issue.
SPEAKER_01 [270.00-272.00]:  But now, we have overcome that.
SPEAKER_01 [272.00-274.00]:  So, now, those cases are not there.
SPEAKER_01 [274.00-276.00]:  The complaint that comes,
SPEAKER_01 [276.00-277.00]:  actually, I repeat,
SPEAKER_01 [277.00-278.00]:  it is your reporting, right?
SPEAKER_00 [278.00-279.00]:  We start that.
SPEAKER_00 [279.00-280.00]:  It doesn't come.

SPEAKER_00 [284.00-285.00]:  IT, IT.

SPEAKER_01 [3.50-5.50]:  It is written in red.
SPEAKER_01 [5.50-7.50]:  But sometimes this happens.
SPEAKER_01 [7.50-11.50]:  If you want to show it to someone, you know it is not working.
SPEAKER_00 [11.50-18.50]:  Okay sir, in this too, our new IOT board 1.5, that will solve a lot of issues.
SPEAKER_00 [18.50-21.50]:  Because now in our board, there are issues of connectivity.
SPEAKER_00 [21.50-24.50]:  But we are coming up with a new board that will take care of the connectivity.
SPEAKER_00 [24.50-28.50]:  Because it is SIM, so it keeps on getting data till then.
SPEAKER_00 [28.50-32.50]:  Okay, let's keep moving forward because you don't have much time now.
SPEAKER_01 [32.50-34.50]:  Because you have other projects.
SPEAKER_01 [34.50-37.50]:  This is a product wise break up, MA02, MA03.

SPEAKER_01 [67.50-69.50]:  I don't know who is going to whom.
SPEAKER_01 [69.50-71.50]:  Okay, fine.
SPEAKER_01 [71.50-73.50]:  We know which one is Solace.
SPEAKER_01 [73.50-76.50]:  That is Solace with Solace.

SPEAKER_00 [122.50-125.50]:  We have to reach 6693 by the end of June.
SPEAKER_00 [125.50-129.50]:  Including the Fishtra.
SPEAKER_00 [129.50-131.50]:  Yes, that too.
SPEAKER_00 [131.50-132.50]:  So this is not there.
SPEAKER_00 [132.50-133.50]:  You won't be able to do this.
SPEAKER_00 [133.50-135.50]:  We have 5901 units.
SPEAKER_00 [135.50-137.50]:  700 units are not there.
SPEAKER_01 [137.50-138.50]:  Two months?

SPEAKER_00 [149.50-150.50]:  Inshallah.
SPEAKER_00 [150.50-151.50]:  Inshallah.
SPEAKER_00 [151.50-157.50]:  This is the DDS report of our top 5 areas in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad.
SPEAKER_00 [157.50-158.50]:  Interesting start.
SPEAKER_00 [158.50-159.50]:  Bahria town.
SPEAKER_00 [159.50-160.50]:  DHA.
SPEAKER_00 [160.50-164.50]:  You see Islamabad.
SPEAKER_00 [164.50-166.50]:  We have a lot of deployments in Bahria town.
SPEAKER_00 [166.50-167.50]:  In DHA.
SPEAKER_00 [167.50-169.50]:  In Lahore, we have the most in DHA.
SPEAKER_00 [169.50-172.50]:  Followed by Gulberg, Garden town, Bahria town.
SPEAKER_00 [172.50-175.50]:  In Karachi, we have the most deployments in DHA.
SPEAKER_00 [175.50-176.50]:  In PC.
SPEAKER_00 [176.50-177.50]:  In DHS.
SPEAKER_00 [177.50-178.50]:  In Clifton.
SPEAKER_00 [178.50-181.50]:  In Iqbal and Gulistan-e-Johar.
SPEAKER_00 [181.50-186.50]:  If you see, 91% of our deployments are low DDS.
SPEAKER_00 [186.50-189.50]:  So anything below 1000 is low DDS.
SPEAKER_00 [189.50-195.50]:  So our dispenser, its performance, its optimal performance is below 2000 DDS.
SPEAKER_00 [195.50-198.50]:  So it will perform perfectly fine.
SPEAKER_00 [198.50-203.50]:  So initially, even above 2000 DDS, our initial churn was in the early years.
SPEAKER_00 [203.50-205.50]:  We were aggressive in our selling.
SPEAKER_00 [205.50-206.50]:  We sold above 2000 DDS.
SPEAKER_00 [206.50-210.50]:  But now we realize with practice that if we sell below 2000 DDS, then we will be in the
SPEAKER_00 [210.50-211.50]:  low DDS.
SPEAKER_00 [211.50-212.50]:  What is this slide saying?
SPEAKER_00 [212.50-213.50]:  I mean, what is this DDS report top 5 areas?
SPEAKER_01 [213.50-214.50]:  Sir, these are our deployments in KLIMA.
SPEAKER_01 [214.50-215.50]:  So if you see, in the 0 to 1000, there are 25 units in Bahria town.
SPEAKER_01 [215.50-216.50]:  In the same way.
SPEAKER_00 [216.50-217.50]:  Okay, okay, okay.
SPEAKER_00 [217.50-218.50]:  I got it.
SPEAKER_00 [218.50-219.50]:  Sorry, I misunderstood those numbers.
SPEAKER_00 [219.50-220.50]:  Yeah.
SPEAKER_00 [220.50-221.50]:  These are the top 5 areas.
SPEAKER_00 [221.50-222.50]:  What is the reason for the overall low sales in Islamabad?
SPEAKER_00 [222.50-223.50]:  Behavioral lifestyle?
SPEAKER_01 [223.50-224.50]:  Or the low sales?
SPEAKER_01 [224.50-225.50]:  What is the reason for the low sales?
SPEAKER_01 [225.50-226.50]:  What is the reason for the low sales?
SPEAKER_01 [226.50-227.50]:  What is the reason for the low sales?
SPEAKER_01 [227.50-228.50]:  What is the reason for the low sales?
SPEAKER_01 [228.50-229.50]:  It's not a good team to thin.
SPEAKER_00 [229.50-230.50]:  No.
SPEAKER_00 [230.50-231.50]:  Not a good team to thin?
SPEAKER_00 [231.50-232.50]:  Islamabad.
SPEAKER_00 [232.50-233.84]:  Not a good team to huge.
SPEAKER_00 [233.84-234.84]:  Hmm.
SPEAKER_00 [234.84-235.84]:  I'm very clear over there.
SPEAKER_00 [235.84-236.84]:  Yeah, Islamabad…
SPEAKER_00 [236.84-241.76]:  I think the potential of Islamabad is going down today.
SPEAKER_00 [241.76-242.90]:  Yeah, Islamabad.
SPEAKER_01 [242.90-246.28]:  Now we have, this is the first month where Lahore,
SPEAKER_00 [246.28-248.52]:  generalized lifestyle products, all of these in Islamabad and there are doctors
SPEAKER_00 [248.52-249.98]:  In the next quarter.
SPEAKER_00 [249.98-255.68]:  In the next quarter, you'll see a new change in these numbers coming from Lahore and Islamabad.
SPEAKER_00 [255.68-258.48]:  So we are maintaining based on the results from the situation.
SPEAKER_00 [258.48-263.92]:  a few changes in the sales team and they have already started showing the results.
SPEAKER_00 [263.92-269.52]:  So this number will be quite different. Even in April, this is the first month of the quarter,
SPEAKER_00 [269.52-273.76]:  so Lahore's numbers have significantly doubled.
SPEAKER_00 [273.76-284.72]:  This is our report, a live report through which we can see the units on the map.
SPEAKER_00 [284.72-290.00]:  So when I visit with the sales team, we can actually see where our units are located.
SPEAKER_00 [290.00-296.40]:  So go to this house, go here, go to this street, go to the next one, which unit is installed on it, what is its ARPU.
SPEAKER_00 [296.40-300.24]:  So it's a very interesting analysis that we do sitting with the sales team.
SPEAKER_00 [0.00-3.00]:  It was located near the Armangan.
SPEAKER_00 [3.00-5.00]:  It was located near the Armangan.
SPEAKER_01 [5.00-7.00]:  It was located near the Armangan.
SPEAKER_03 [7.00-9.00]:  It is a busy area.
SPEAKER_04 [9.00-15.00]:  If we look at the ARPU, the ARPU of Internet and water is the same, right?
SPEAKER_04 [15.00-17.00]:  3600.
SPEAKER_04 [17.00-25.00]:  In this 3600, I think what is important is the ARPU of this year.
SPEAKER_01 [25.00-28.00]:  This year's ARPU is about 4200.
SPEAKER_02 [28.00-30.00]:  These are some legacy ones.
SPEAKER_02 [30.00-33.00]:  I was comparing water and Internet.
SPEAKER_04 [33.00-34.00]:  Yes, that's right.
SPEAKER_04 [34.00-35.00]:  In Pakistan, it is the same price, right?
SPEAKER_04 [35.00-38.00]:  No, sir, look at the landscape of water.
SPEAKER_01 [38.00-40.00]:  It is so diverse.
SPEAKER_01 [40.00-43.00]:  There are innumerable stakeholders.
SPEAKER_01 [43.00-46.00]:  Look, the price of the Internet is very low in Pakistan.
SPEAKER_04 [46.00-49.00]:  60% of the Internet is a dollar rise.
SPEAKER_04 [49.00-51.00]:  Internet Fed.
SPEAKER_04 [51.00-54.00]:  I was saying that water and Internet are the same in Pakistan.
SPEAKER_04 [54.00-57.00]:  This is the trend in the world.
SPEAKER_04 [57.00-58.00]:  This is also the trend in the world.
SPEAKER_04 [58.00-60.00]:  I was asking Zaheer.
SPEAKER_04 [60.00-65.00]:  Zaheer says that the Internet is expensive in the UAE.
SPEAKER_04 [65.00-68.00]:  Water is also very expensive in the United States.
SPEAKER_00 [68.00-71.00]:  No, but water is cheap in Pakistan.
SPEAKER_01 [71.00-72.00]:  Water is also expensive in the US.
SPEAKER_01 [72.00-74.00]:  Water is cheap.
SPEAKER_01 [74.00-78.00]:  People are drinking water for 50 rupees.
SPEAKER_01 [78.00-80.00]:  People are drinking water for 50 rupees.
SPEAKER_01 [80.00-83.00]:  Most people are drinking water for 50 rupees.

SPEAKER_01 [99.00-101.00]:  But the Internet is right in this market.
SPEAKER_01 [101.00-104.00]:  Internet is right in this market.
SPEAKER_01 [104.00-105.00]:  The Internet is right in this market.
SPEAKER_01 [105.00-107.00]:  From 3500 to 4000 to 4000.
SPEAKER_00 [107.00-112.00]:  In the rest, there are connections of 500, 700, 800 rupees.

SPEAKER_04 [225.00-232.00]:  My point was that, Gaurav sir, to acquire 5000 customers, whether it is internet or water,
SPEAKER_04 [232.00-239.00]:  acquisition cost of 5000 customers on internet and water bottles is cheap, right?
SPEAKER_04 [239.00-241.00]:  On bottles or on machines?
SPEAKER_04 [241.00-245.00]:  Let's say 5000 rupees, 5000 customers can be acquired.
SPEAKER_04 [245.00-246.00]:  So, 35000 rupees.
SPEAKER_04 [246.00-248.00]:  I can do internet or water.
SPEAKER_03 [248.00-251.00]:  Acquisition cost of internet is 35000 rupees, 35000 to 40,000.
SPEAKER_03 [251.00-253.00]:  Here, it is 1 lakh rupees.
SPEAKER_03 [253.00-254.00]:  90,000 rupees.
SPEAKER_03 [254.00-255.00]:  It is a good deal.
SPEAKER_03 [255.00-256.00]:  No, no.
SPEAKER_03 [256.00-257.00]:  I am talking about acquisition cost.
SPEAKER_02 [257.00-258.00]:  Not revenue.
SPEAKER_02 [258.00-260.00]:  You are talking about customer acquisition.
SPEAKER_02 [260.00-261.00]:  50,000 rupees is cheap.
SPEAKER_02 [261.00-262.00]:  No, Sai.
SPEAKER_02 [262.00-263.00]:  You are talking about that.
SPEAKER_02 [263.00-267.00]:  You are talking about customer on behalf of customer to acquire that.
SPEAKER_02 [267.00-272.00]:  You tell me, me as a seller, what is my cost?
SPEAKER_02 [272.00-273.00]:  I think his question is that.
SPEAKER_02 [273.00-274.00]:  Money is 5 lakhs.
SPEAKER_02 [274.00-276.00]:  Money is 5 lakhs.
SPEAKER_04 [276.00-278.00]:  Should I put here or here?
SPEAKER_04 [278.00-279.00]:  Put here.
SPEAKER_03 [279.00-282.00]:  35000 rupees per connection cost is internet.
SPEAKER_03 [282.00-283.00]:  Sorry.
SPEAKER_03 [283.00-284.00]:  I am talking about internet.
SPEAKER_03 [284.00-285.00]:  35000 rupees.
SPEAKER_03 [285.00-286.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_03 [286.00-287.00]:  It is 35000 rupees.
SPEAKER_03 [287.00-290.00]:  He has cost of 90000 rupees but he has recovered 40,000 rupees.
SPEAKER_03 [290.00-292.00]:  So, net cost is 50000 rupees.
SPEAKER_03 [292.00-295.00]:  So, 35000, 40,000 versus 50000.
SPEAKER_03 [295.00-296.00]:  This is the cost.
SPEAKER_03 [296.00-298.00]:  In ARPU, this is better.
SPEAKER_03 [298.00-300.00]:  ARPU is 42.
SPEAKER_04 [0.00-4.60]:  and in gross because there is no dollar
SPEAKER_04 [4.60-9.10]:  you know operating expense is not in dollar so its margin is good
SPEAKER_04 [9.10-11.10]:  margin of mywater is good
SPEAKER_04 [11.10-15.10]:  there it is in 20-25%
SPEAKER_04 [15.10-17.10]:  now it is in service
SPEAKER_05 [17.10-19.10]:  yes service margin is good
SPEAKER_05 [19.10-23.10]:  then service margin of mywater is good
SPEAKER_05 [23.10-27.10]:  because once they put machine and go
SPEAKER_05 [27.10-30.10]:  they are cutting wire and etc
SPEAKER_04 [30.10-32.10]:  car, petrol and all these things
SPEAKER_04 [32.10-34.10]:  he was saying that in 3 months service will be done
SPEAKER_04 [34.10-39.10]:  he will also go to motorcycle and say that he does not need to climb the ladder
SPEAKER_01 [39.10-42.10]:  and that is what we as a customer
SPEAKER_01 [42.10-46.10]:  for me the best selling point of mywater is convenience
SPEAKER_01 [46.10-49.10]:  Nestle remaining the same everything remaining the same
SPEAKER_01 [49.10-53.10]:  its my responsibility that he is bringing and lifting
SPEAKER_01 [53.10-56.10]:  lifting that bottle and putting it on top of this
SPEAKER_01 [56.10-57.10]:  or one time
SPEAKER_01 [57.10-59.10]:  hygiene is very important
SPEAKER_02 [59.10-60.10]:  and we should not do big things
SPEAKER_02 [60.10-61.10]:  like
SPEAKER_01 [61.10-63.10]:  strike or rain or something

SPEAKER_04 [138.10-139.10]:  I will tell you
SPEAKER_04 [139.10-140.10]:  single
SPEAKER_04 [140.10-141.10]:  no no
SPEAKER_04 [141.10-142.10]:  that police station
SPEAKER_04 [142.10-143.10]:  traffic police's street
SPEAKER_04 [143.10-144.10]:  that corner house
SPEAKER_04 [144.10-145.10]:  Sir
SPEAKER_00 [145.10-149.34]:  only your uncle
SPEAKER_05 [149.34-151.86]:  Ling has removed from parks
SPEAKER_05 [151.86-154.22]:  High street
SPEAKER_05 [154.22-154.98]:  I have stopped till了
SPEAKER_03 [155.10-155.46]:  I have smaller
SPEAKER_03 [155.46-170.16]:  Looking at the
SPEAKER_02 [170.16-170.86]:  we plastic
SPEAKER_02 [170.86-171.20]:  street
SPEAKER_02 [171.20-171.86]: Да
SPEAKER_02 [171.86-172.82]:  to get into we are looking for
SPEAKER_02 [172.82-173.82]:  beautification
SPEAKER_02 [173.82-174.90]:  see that
SPEAKER_02 [174.90-182.90]:  Basically, both beneficiaries, Pakistan and UAE, are going to see this benefit.
SPEAKER_02 [182.90-189.90]:  First, our purifier box, where all the filters are installed, is all very exposed.
SPEAKER_02 [189.90-198.90]:  In the sense that only we know what's going inside each filter, but to a common person, it looks like it's not very well contained.
SPEAKER_02 [198.90-203.90]:  It's not, you know, there are wires, we have cleaned it up, but still it needs a lot of work.
SPEAKER_02 [203.90-212.90]:  So, the product development we are doing right now, the white box you are seeing, we're going to put this box into each machine,
SPEAKER_02 [212.90-218.90]:  and then the filters up there will come and we'll replace them. The technician will come and replace the filters and then leave.
SPEAKER_02 [218.90-223.90]:  All the electronics, the pumps, everything is going to be inside that white box.
SPEAKER_02 [223.90-227.90]:  And this white box is going to be the engine of any system.
SPEAKER_02 [227.90-232.90]:  So, if for some reason the box is not acting up, or if the problem is not being fixed,
SPEAKER_02 [232.90-233.90]:  the technician will come and replace it.
SPEAKER_02 [233.90-237.90]:  The technician will come and replace the box instead of replacing a unit.
SPEAKER_02 [237.90-240.90]:  The other one is the MySoda unit.
SPEAKER_02 [240.90-246.90]:  We did some demonstrations in QBR last year, with units here, with soda.
SPEAKER_02 [246.90-251.90]:  Because our mission was to start with still water and then go down the line.
SPEAKER_02 [251.90-257.90]:  Sparkling water being the number two most consumed after still water.
SPEAKER_02 [257.90-260.90]:  And then we add flavors and other components to it.
SPEAKER_02 [260.90-262.90]:  So, in MySoda, we have developed a tabletop.
SPEAKER_02 [262.90-267.90]:  The one we presented in QBR last year was version one.
SPEAKER_02 [267.90-271.90]:  And when we put that out in the field, we saw some challenges.
SPEAKER_02 [271.90-275.90]:  And both in terms of cost, the cost was very high.
SPEAKER_02 [275.90-277.90]:  The manufacturing was also complicated.
SPEAKER_02 [277.90-279.90]:  The issues of service could have come.
SPEAKER_02 [279.90-284.90]:  So, we went and developed generation two, version two of it, which is much simpler.
SPEAKER_02 [284.90-289.90]:  Cost is very comparable to the actual normal Terra unit.
SPEAKER_02 [289.90-291.90]:  So, there's a tabletop version and there's a standalone.
SPEAKER_02 [291.90-295.90]:  And one faucet is going to be cold and one faucet is going to be sparkling.
SPEAKER_02 [295.90-299.90]:  Or we're going to work on all three options where it's hot.
SPEAKER_03 [0.00-3.00]:  hold and you press that button and you get sparkling water.
SPEAKER_03 [3.00-5.00]:  Why do you need hot?
SPEAKER_03 [5.00-7.00]:  For various purposes.
SPEAKER_03 [7.00-10.00]:  Actually it's for
SPEAKER_03 [10.00-12.00]:  coffee.
SPEAKER_03 [12.00-16.00]:  If you have it, you can drink coffee with it.
SPEAKER_02 [16.00-19.00]:  No, I don't do that. I say why do you need it in soda?
SPEAKER_01 [19.00-23.00]:  When people use it in office, they drink coffee and not soda.
SPEAKER_02 [23.00-27.00]:  So, cost of upgrading an existing unit
SPEAKER_03 [27.00-30.00]:  to this one is only going to be
SPEAKER_03 [30.00-32.00]:  6,000 to 7,000 rupees.
SPEAKER_03 [32.00-35.00]:  But the premium that sparkling water
SPEAKER_03 [35.00-38.00]:  can demand is very high.
SPEAKER_03 [38.00-41.00]:  You will have control and supply of gas?
SPEAKER_02 [41.00-42.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_03 [42.00-45.00]:  We will give you a subscription for the tanks.
SPEAKER_03 [45.00-48.00]:  And then you can reorder it.
SPEAKER_01 [48.00-50.00]:  And we will get to...
SPEAKER_01 [50.00-54.00]:  And then one tank,
SPEAKER_03 [54.00-56.00]:  one carbon dioxide, the small silver tank
SPEAKER_03 [56.00-57.00]:  you are seeing,
SPEAKER_03 [57.00-59.00]:  that tank,
SPEAKER_03 [59.00-62.00]:  our cost of filling this in-house of gas is
SPEAKER_03 [62.00-64.00]:  approximately
SPEAKER_03 [64.00-65.00]:  40 rupees.
SPEAKER_03 [65.00-67.00]:  One glass costs 6 rupees.
SPEAKER_01 [67.00-70.00]:  Tank is 40 rupees.
SPEAKER_02 [70.00-75.00]:  Tank is 40 rupees or that tank will give about 100 glasses.
SPEAKER_03 [75.00-78.00]:  So, about 5 rupees you get a sparkling water and then
SPEAKER_03 [78.00-81.00]:  we have also developed some flavors
SPEAKER_03 [81.00-83.00]:  that will cost another
SPEAKER_03 [83.00-85.00]:  10 rupees.
SPEAKER_03 [85.00-86.00]:  So, you will have 15 rupees
SPEAKER_03 [86.00-90.00]:  and you get a glass or as you get a carbonated beverage
SPEAKER_03 [90.00-93.00]:  compared to a can which costs 100 rupees.
SPEAKER_03 [93.00-94.00]:  Absolutely.
SPEAKER_03 [94.00-97.00]:  And the replacement cost for these things
SPEAKER_02 [97.00-98.00]:  which is 40 rupees,
SPEAKER_02 [98.00-100.00]:  if you sell them, it will be 500 rupees.
SPEAKER_02 [100.00-101.00]:  1200 rupees, 1500 rupees.
SPEAKER_02 [101.00-103.00]:  1200 rupees, 1500 rupees.
SPEAKER_02 [103.00-104.00]:  We will maintain this price.
SPEAKER_02 [104.00-106.00]:  No one will understand this business.
SPEAKER_02 [106.00-112.00]:  For the environment, this refill model
SPEAKER_02 [112.00-114.00]:  can be used for this money.
SPEAKER_02 [114.00-121.00]:  So, this is the Solace 3.
SPEAKER_03 [121.00-123.00]:  That's an upgrade of our industrial unit.
SPEAKER_03 [123.00-126.00]:  This has almost a 50 liter capacity.
SPEAKER_03 [126.00-129.00]:  It can serve up to 100 people.
SPEAKER_03 [129.00-131.00]:  This one is a sensor based one.
SPEAKER_03 [131.00-133.00]:  We will also give a button option for people
SPEAKER_03 [133.00-135.00]:  who don't want sensors.
SPEAKER_03 [135.00-137.00]:  So, we will have a sensor version
SPEAKER_03 [137.00-140.00]:  and a button version and or both.
SPEAKER_03 [140.00-142.00]:  We have installed this in this hospital.
SPEAKER_03 [142.00-143.00]:  We have about 23 units.
SPEAKER_03 [143.00-144.00]:  23 units.
SPEAKER_03 [144.00-146.00]:  23 units deployed in this
SPEAKER_03 [146.00-149.00]:  and we have a few other deployed in the field.
SPEAKER_03 [149.00-150.00]:  We will launch this next month.
SPEAKER_03 [150.00-152.00]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_01 [152.00-155.00]:  The unit installed in this industry,
SPEAKER_01 [155.00-157.00]:  the cost of that unit,
SPEAKER_01 [157.00-159.00]:  if procured, imported,
SPEAKER_01 [159.00-161.00]:  that's 3000 dollars.
SPEAKER_01 [161.00-162.00]:  Right?
SPEAKER_01 [162.00-164.00]:  3200 dollars.
SPEAKER_01 [164.00-165.00]:  3200 dollars.
SPEAKER_01 [165.00-167.00]:  And we have made the same unit
SPEAKER_01 [167.00-169.00]:  in 2 lakhs, less than 2 lakhs.
SPEAKER_01 [169.00-171.00]:  And the cost will further come now.
SPEAKER_01 [171.00-172.00]:  Approximately 1.5 lakhs.
SPEAKER_01 [172.00-173.00]:  Absolutely.
SPEAKER_01 [173.00-174.00]:  5 lakhs.
SPEAKER_01 [174.00-176.00]:  But I was just thinking that
SPEAKER_00 [176.00-179.00]:  your revenue is only 5% or 10%
SPEAKER_00 [179.00-181.00]:  these devices.
SPEAKER_00 [181.00-182.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_00 [182.00-184.00]:  I told you that it will be 5-10%.
SPEAKER_00 [184.00-186.00]:  That's why I was saying that
SPEAKER_02 [186.00-188.00]:  what you said today,
SPEAKER_02 [188.00-190.00]:  I said that you will see the revenue change.
SPEAKER_02 [190.00-191.00]:  But anyway, I don't want to comment.
SPEAKER_02 [191.00-193.00]:  We have introduced the old version
SPEAKER_01 [193.00-195.00]:  about 12 months ago.
SPEAKER_01 [195.00-197.00]:  No, no, its revenue will be fine,
SPEAKER_02 [197.00-198.00]:  God willing.
SPEAKER_02 [198.00-200.00]:  We can take it further.
SPEAKER_02 [201.00-202.00]:  But the consumption is very high.
SPEAKER_02 [202.00-203.00]:  If the consumption is very high,
SPEAKER_02 [203.00-204.00]:  then it's okay, there is a difference.
SPEAKER_02 [204.00-205.00]:  Yes.
SPEAKER_03 [205.00-207.00]:  So,
SPEAKER_03 [207.00-208.00]:  and then,
SPEAKER_03 [208.00-210.00]:  so the next on the software side,
SPEAKER_03 [210.00-212.00]:  we have to take our CRM
SPEAKER_03 [212.00-214.00]:  to the 3.0 version.
SPEAKER_03 [214.00-216.00]:  And we are working on some updates
SPEAKER_03 [216.00-218.00]:  in terms of
SPEAKER_03 [218.00-219.00]:  revamping the app,
SPEAKER_03 [219.00-220.00]:  app design
SPEAKER_03 [220.00-222.00]:  and launching that app
SPEAKER_03 [222.00-223.00]:  hopefully in the next,
SPEAKER_03 [223.00-224.00]:  in this coming,
SPEAKER_03 [224.00-225.00]:  in this quarter.
SPEAKER_03 [225.00-227.00]:  And the CRM version
SPEAKER_03 [227.00-229.00]:  which would be replicated
SPEAKER_03 [229.00-230.00]:  from Dubai
SPEAKER_03 [230.00-231.00]:  and a few other international territories
SPEAKER_03 [231.00-233.00]:  that we are looking at launching.
SPEAKER_03 [233.00-237.00]:  And this will have an actual sort of AI
SPEAKER_03 [239.00-240.00]:  program running
SPEAKER_03 [240.00-243.00]:  for servicing these units more effectively.
SPEAKER_03 [243.00-245.00]:  And then obviously telling us things like
SPEAKER_03 [245.00-247.00]:  churn ratios,
SPEAKER_03 [247.00-249.00]:  customer temperatures,
SPEAKER_03 [249.00-251.00]:  unit conditions in terms of kidney complaints,
SPEAKER_03 [251.00-252.00]:  you know, stuff like that,
SPEAKER_03 [252.00-255.00]:  just to kind of offer a better customer service.
SPEAKER_03 [255.00-257.00]:  The next one that we are experimenting,
SPEAKER_03 [257.00-259.00]:  we're going to start experimenting with
SPEAKER_03 [259.00-260.00]:  is the water ATM.
SPEAKER_03 [260.00-262.00]:  This is going to be,
SPEAKER_03 [262.00-263.00]:  again,
SPEAKER_03 [263.00-264.00]:  we're going to start a pilot
SPEAKER_03 [264.00-266.00]:  with a few people already lined up
SPEAKER_03 [266.00-267.00]:  where they can,
SPEAKER_03 [267.00-268.00]:  you know,
SPEAKER_03 [268.00-270.00]:  they can fill up 19 liter bottles
SPEAKER_03 [270.00-272.00]:  at a fraction of a cost.
SPEAKER_03 [272.00-274.00]:  This is for that mid-market,
SPEAKER_03 [274.00-276.00]:  local market areas,
SPEAKER_03 [276.00-277.00]:  creating commercial points
SPEAKER_03 [277.00-279.00]:  for water refilling.
SPEAKER_03 [279.00-281.00]:  The next one is a micro bottling system.
SPEAKER_03 [281.00-284.00]:  We have a bottling system
SPEAKER_03 [284.00-286.00]:  installed in My Water Pakistan,
SPEAKER_03 [286.00-288.00]:  which we are refilling.
SPEAKER_03 [288.00-289.00]:  And one,
SPEAKER_03 [289.00-292.00]:  we have deployed in Dubai at Hilton Abu Dhabi.
SPEAKER_03 [292.00-295.00]:  And this micro bottling one is going to be,
SPEAKER_03 [295.00-297.00]:  that one here is going to be
SPEAKER_03 [297.00-298.00]:  going to be
SPEAKER_03 [298.00-300.00]:  going to be
SPEAKER_01 [0.00-11.44]:  This is going to be on wheels and it will go into every restaurant, small hotels and
SPEAKER_00 [11.44-16.20]:  we're going to pilot this in Pakistan and then sell this in the Middle East as well.
SPEAKER_00 [16.20-23.02]:  This can go into let's say a small hotel like Beast Luxury or even Awari for that matter
SPEAKER_00 [23.02-25.70]:  and they will do their own bottling on site.
SPEAKER_00 [25.70-31.20]:  Everything would be fully automated so you don't need specialized skilled people to operate
SPEAKER_00 [31.20-32.20]:  it.
SPEAKER_00 [32.20-37.70]:  And then the last one is the IoT 2.0 where we're working on some new sensors to improve
SPEAKER_00 [37.70-39.56]:  water quality detection.
SPEAKER_00 [39.56-45.94]:  Again the service component and connectivity like Shah Rukh said earlier.
SPEAKER_00 [45.94-51.94]:  Arsalan, next one.
SPEAKER_00 [51.94-54.94]:  One small.
SPEAKER_00 [55.70-56.70]:  One small.
SPEAKER_00 [57.70-72.70]:  So from our international division, we are basically, we had a mission of launching MyWater
SPEAKER_00 [72.70-79.20]:  International and we launched UAE about one and a half years ago and we are in talks to
SPEAKER_00 [79.20-83.70]:  launch Saudi Arabia in the next two to three months.
SPEAKER_00 [83.70-84.70]:  And one of the projects in Saudi Arabia is the UAE.
SPEAKER_00 [84.70-85.20]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_00 [85.20-92.20]:  So Saudi Arabia is this organization called GAYTH that's a charity arm of Raji Bank in
SPEAKER_00 [92.20-93.20]:  Saudi Arabia.
SPEAKER_00 [93.20-96.20]:  The largest bank holdings in the country.
SPEAKER_00 [96.20-103.20]:  And what they do is, GAYTH is one of many that they give water for Umrah and Hajj.
SPEAKER_00 [103.20-113.20]:  So all the people who go to Mecca, Medina, they are giving water with small bottles.
SPEAKER_00 [113.20-119.20]:  The problem with that, the whole, you know, that exercise is there's a huge, they spend
SPEAKER_00 [119.20-125.20]:  about, they spend about, I think $4 million a year or something for that water.
SPEAKER_00 [125.20-127.20]:  Just one organization.
SPEAKER_00 [127.20-134.20]:  There are many like them, but they spend that money every year or for plastic waste bottles.
SPEAKER_00 [134.20-141.20]:  So we came up, they came to us for, you know, wanting to eliminate plastic bottles and this unit you see are going to be placed.
SPEAKER_00 [141.20-142.20]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_00 [142.20-153.20]:  Everywhere in Mecca, Medina, all the points around where people walk below hotels in and around the, you know, around the Haram and all that stuff.
SPEAKER_00 [153.20-163.20]:  And here people will have cold water, it will be battery powered, 24 seven operations, solar will be there and it will provide cold water all day long.
SPEAKER_00 [163.20-171.20]:  And we have installed some, you know, theatrics, we've installed a screen for to show them whatever there is some kind of advisory going on.
SPEAKER_00 [171.20-172.20]:  Okay.
SPEAKER_00 [172.20-183.20]:  .
SPEAKER_00 [183.20-189.20]:  Especially in the summer months.
SPEAKER_00 [189.20-199.20]:  And then there is an enhanced version of this 24 containerized version Joe, we are we are proposing to put this on Arafat.
SPEAKER_00 [199.20-201.20]:  After traveling that much, there is a, yeah, there's only two to three days in a year.
SPEAKER_00 [201.20-204.20]:  there and these units all around.
SPEAKER_00 [204.20-207.92]:  So even from the consumption, just this organization,
SPEAKER_00 [207.92-210.56]:  we're looking at about 15, 20 units of these.
SPEAKER_00 [210.56-214.46]:  Then once they do a pilot, then all the other organizations
SPEAKER_00 [214.46-220.40]:  will also follow to be able to do the cost reduction
SPEAKER_00 [220.40-222.92]:  that we would do is 70%.
SPEAKER_00 [222.92-225.30]:  Like just they would pay up for all of this
SPEAKER_00 [225.30-227.12]:  with servicing everything.
SPEAKER_00 [227.12-231.62]:  They would save 70% from year one on their current cost.
SPEAKER_00 [231.62-233.62]:  So have you signed the contract and everything?
SPEAKER_00 [233.62-237.56]:  No, we're in the process of they're going to visit.
SPEAKER_00 [237.56-239.48]:  We're going to visit here.
SPEAKER_00 [239.48-240.86]:  We're going to show them the unit.
SPEAKER_00 [240.86-242.30]:  And meanwhile, in parallel, we're
SPEAKER_00 [242.30-244.82]:  setting up an organization in Saudi Arabia
SPEAKER_00 [244.82-249.26]:  that they can kind of set up a service arm
SPEAKER_00 [249.26-250.40]:  and they can have a local.
SPEAKER_00 [250.40-252.32]:  So the Hajj is coming, it's not happening here.
SPEAKER_00 [252.32-253.28]:  I think it's next year.
SPEAKER_00 [253.28-253.78]:  Next year.
SPEAKER_00 [253.78-254.72]:  They've wanted this.
SPEAKER_00 [254.72-256.16]:  They're not here for Hajj.
SPEAKER_00 [256.16-257.12]:  Hajj Umrah, Hajj Umrah.
SPEAKER_00 [257.12-258.66]:  Hajj Umrah, Hajj Umrah.
SPEAKER_00 [258.66-259.30]:  Perpetual.
SPEAKER_00 [259.30-261.98]:  Yes, it's perpetual.
SPEAKER_00 [261.98-262.98]:  It continues.
SPEAKER_00 [262.98-264.68]:  It will continue.
SPEAKER_00 [264.68-265.72]:  This is good.
SPEAKER_00 [265.72-269.58]:  But this will be, inshallah, deployed before next year.
SPEAKER_00 [269.58-271.88]:  The person who has promoted this,
SPEAKER_00 [271.88-276.48]:  he also told us that send us 20 units of Najaf, too.
SPEAKER_00 [276.48-277.88]:  And do it there.
SPEAKER_00 [282.74-285.50]:  A little bit on My Water UAE.
SPEAKER_00 [285.50-286.78]:  We had sort of scaled down.
SPEAKER_00 [286.78-290.62]:  A lot of different things.
SPEAKER_00 [290.62-295.06]:  On UAE, as you can see in the numbers,
SPEAKER_00 [295.06-298.18]:  we had sort of, we have a very small budget
SPEAKER_00 [298.18-300.04]:  in relative terms.
SPEAKER_00 [0.00-5.60]:  compared to Pakistan for the UAE because we wanted to sort of go back to the lean model
SPEAKER_00 [5.60-10.80]:  and cut our costs and become more efficient before we started growing again.
SPEAKER_00 [10.80-17.60]:  So these are the numbers from actual 2024-25.
SPEAKER_00 [17.60-24.70]:  There is an improvement on gross profit and but EBITDA and a lot of the numbers below are still negative
SPEAKER_00 [24.70-31.40]:  because we still have one project, this Hilton project that I spoke about.
SPEAKER_00 [31.40-38.30]:  We haven't locked it in books yet, we will lock it in May when our final invoice payment comes.
SPEAKER_00 [38.30-44.50]:  And that one project alone is about a million and 45,000 dirhams.
SPEAKER_00 [44.50-49.30]:  So in that project, we will have enough capital to obviously make the company positive
SPEAKER_00 [49.30-54.50]:  and invest back in a lean way of growing in the UAE.
SPEAKER_00 [54.50-57.50]:  And whatever other international ambitions we have.
SPEAKER_00 [57.50-69.70]:  The same group that just to kind of show you budget versus actual.
SPEAKER_00 [69.70-75.50]:  The roadmap for UAE is we have a plant on site.
SPEAKER_00 [75.50-80.90]:  We have a MOU signed for 21 hotels with the same owners on 21 hotels.
SPEAKER_00 [80.90-84.40]:  Some are Hampton, Hilton, Conrad, this type of hotels.
SPEAKER_00 [84.40-94.40]:  We have one deployed on site and we are positioning ourselves to have one unit deployed in a hotel every quarter
SPEAKER_00 [94.40-101.40]:  and have four on-site plants running for the whole year as a pilot with them before they scale into the other hotels.
SPEAKER_00 [101.40-110.40]:  And then we use that as a launchpad to pitch to other hotels and other groups, at least in the UAE region.
SPEAKER_00 [110.40-113.40]:  And then we go to Saudi Arabia.
SPEAKER_00 [113.40-115.40]:  We have a lot of local production.
SPEAKER_00 [115.40-117.40]:  We have a lot of local production.
SPEAKER_00 [117.40-121.40]:  Our plan is to scale up local production from 5 to 25% by Q4.
SPEAKER_00 [121.40-123.40]:  We are in talks with Al Fatem group.
SPEAKER_00 [123.40-127.40]:  We've gone through all the tender and all of that stuff.
SPEAKER_00 [127.40-135.40]:  We're waiting for a purchase order any day now on a group level deployment for Al Fatem, for UAE.
SPEAKER_00 [135.40-141.40]:  So for that, the unit count is going to be about three to 400 units.
SPEAKER_00 [141.40-145.40]:  So that's going to be about three to 400 units.
SPEAKER_00 [145.40-147.40]:  So we're waiting for that to happen.
SPEAKER_00 [147.40-149.40]:  We're waiting for that to happen.
SPEAKER_00 [149.40-151.40]:  We're waiting for that to happen.
SPEAKER_00 [151.40-153.40]:  We're waiting for that to happen.
SPEAKER_00 [153.40-155.40]:  So we're waiting for that to happen.
SPEAKER_00 [155.40-157.40]:  And then we're going to have to scale up local production.
SPEAKER_00 [157.40-159.40]:  And then we're going to have to scale up local production.
SPEAKER_00 [159.40-163.40]:  Because when we manufacture these units in Dubai, they are 30% cheaper than Pakistan.
SPEAKER_00 [163.40-166.40]:  So then we will scale up local production.
SPEAKER_00 [166.40-169.40]:  And sort of we have to, you know, up-divide and re-ignite some growth mechanisms in UAE in a more lean fashion.
SPEAKER_00 [169.40-171.40]:  And sort of we have to, you know, up-divide and re-ignite some growth mechanisms in UAE in a more lean fashion.
SPEAKER_00 [171.40-173.40]:  And so we're waiting to see what happens.
SPEAKER_00 [173.40-175.40]:  And then we're waiting for that to happen.
SPEAKER_00 [175.40-177.40]:  And in the next quarter, we're going to be setting up a new plant.
SPEAKER_00 [177.40-179.40]:  In the next quarter, we're going to be setting up a new plant.
SPEAKER_00 [179.40-181.40]:  We're going to be piloting in the second quarter.
SPEAKER_00 [181.40-183.40]:  We're going to be piloting in the third quarter.
SPEAKER_00 [183.40-185.40]:  We're going to launch in the third quarter.
SPEAKER_00 [185.40-187.40]:  We've already got our JV partners in.
SPEAKER_00 [187.40-189.40]:  We're going through that whole exercise of set-up.
SPEAKER_00 [189.40-195.40]:  We're going to launch from Jeddah and then Insha'Allah we're going to scale to Madina and Riyadh.
SPEAKER_00 [195.40-197.40]:  We've already got our JV partners in.
SPEAKER_00 [197.40-218.40]:  Al-Fotain gives us units and we scale very slightly on the consumer level and the goal is with the four on-site plants and with scale up of units and some other RO plants that we are trying to lock in deals with, we want to hit a million dollars in revenue for UAE alone in December 2025.
SPEAKER_00 [218.40-226.40]:  How much will be the positive of the bottom line of the on-site plant? 225 units.
SPEAKER_00 [226.40-234.40]:  On-site plant? No, the one behind. The one that is going on is 4 million negative.
SPEAKER_01 [234.40-239.40]:  In the budget, our 22 million was positive. It was March quarter.
SPEAKER_01 [239.40-245.40]:  No, that's fine. The budget is visible. When will this 4 million negative be positive?
SPEAKER_01 [245.40-247.40]:  225 units.
SPEAKER_00 [247.40-248.40]:  On-site?
SPEAKER_00 [248.40-249.40]:  On-site bottling.
SPEAKER_00 [249.40-250.40]:  How much capex will it take?
SPEAKER_01 [250.40-253.40]:  That capex is on the hotel. So we have not taken any capex.
SPEAKER_00 [253.40-256.40]:  No, no, you guys talk about two or three different things.
SPEAKER_02 [256.40-266.40]:  He is talking about how many units, you are telling him how many units he needs. He is asking that to make it positive, if according to me, if your hotel payment comes.
SPEAKER_02 [266.40-267.40]:  Next month it will be positive.
SPEAKER_02 [267.40-268.40]:  Next month it will be positive.
SPEAKER_02 [268.40-271.40]:  The answer to your question is that as soon as it is booked, right now.
SPEAKER_02 [271.40-272.40]:  Is it recurring or?
SPEAKER_02 [272.40-273.40]:  No, it is one time.
SPEAKER_02 [273.40-275.40]:  One time plus some.
SPEAKER_01 [275.40-277.40]:  See, the whole point is that one time.
SPEAKER_01 [277.40-282.40]:  That's fine, that month is done. What will happen next month? It will not come as one time.
SPEAKER_02 [282.40-285.40]:  I think we need to explain.
SPEAKER_02 [285.40-288.40]:  There is recurring of two units.
SPEAKER_02 [288.40-290.40]:  See, it will be like this.
SPEAKER_02 [290.40-291.40]:  250.
SPEAKER_01 [291.40-293.40]:  No, negativity.
SPEAKER_01 [293.40-294.40]:  No, no, no.
SPEAKER_01 [294.40-295.40]:  We will not be able to do it.
SPEAKER_01 [295.40-296.40]:  No, no, no.
SPEAKER_01 [296.40-297.40]:  I know what it is.
SPEAKER_01 [297.40-298.40]:  I know what it is.
SPEAKER_02 [298.40-299.40]:  I know what it is.
SPEAKER_02 [299.40-300.40]:  I know what it is.
SPEAKER_00 [0.00-3.72]:  But the three quarters will cover. After that it will come back.
SPEAKER_02 [3.72-6.96]:  After that, but after that, two, three and four are selling, right?
SPEAKER_00 [6.96-10.44]:  Yes. They are selling three more units, right? Now
SPEAKER_00 [10.44-13.20]:  above one unit, this four million will do it.
SPEAKER_00 [13.20-17.22]:  But now come back. But this is the number,
SPEAKER_01 [17.22-19.98]:  these are the one hundred and thirty-two units that we have deployed in UAE.
SPEAKER_01 [19.98-23.94]:  These are its numbers. Once this number goes to two to five, then this
SPEAKER_01 [23.94-27.36]:  existing business case will be positive and the on-site deployment.
SPEAKER_01 [27.36-30.60]:  How much money do you need for that?
SPEAKER_01 [30.60-34.86]:  No, it won't be ninety-five thousand there.
SPEAKER_02 [34.86-38.36]:  We are now from Pakistan. So that time.
SPEAKER_02 [38.36-42.36]:  Approximately ten million. Ten million. One hundred and thirty thousand.
SPEAKER_02 [42.36-46.36]:  So our profit on the bottling plant that we have just installed,
SPEAKER_02 [46.36-49.36]:  that's going to be about three and a half lakhs.
SPEAKER_02 [49.36-53.36]:  The effort of sales. No, its sales effort is also needed.
SPEAKER_01 [53.36-57.36]:  I was just telling you about the units, but the sales effort is that's a different.
SPEAKER_01 [57.36-66.36]:  But now to achieve our positivity, from one from one thirty to two hundred and twenty-five,
SPEAKER_02 [66.36-69.36]:  we're going to do that with the alpha-tem ordered.
SPEAKER_02 [69.36-74.36]:  That booking is done, right? If it comes to two hundred and thirty, then it will be done automatically.
SPEAKER_00 [74.36-82.36]:  So I think one is your four point four million, which will be done with the hotel payment.
SPEAKER_00 [82.36-86.36]:  And if the alpha-tem comes, then you are recurring.
SPEAKER_02 [87.36-91.36]:  Right. That's it for Pakistan.
SPEAKER_02 [91.36-96.36]:  Final note over here. Here, what my water is, unless there's something else for Pakistan.
SPEAKER_00 [96.36-97.36]:  That's it.
SPEAKER_02 [97.36-105.36]:  So in this, it is that they have to continue to keep investing
SPEAKER_00 [105.36-112.36]:  on their machines and their products and the quality of service continuously to keep.
SPEAKER_00 [112.36-117.36]:  I had thought last year, in the beginning of 2024,
SPEAKER_00 [117.36-121.36]:  because of the type of innovation that was not going on into this.
SPEAKER_00 [121.36-133.36]:  It was probably 18 to 24 months, maybe 12 to 18 months behind competition.
SPEAKER_00 [133.36-138.36]:  But I think the developments that have happened in the last one year and the products are now coming back.
SPEAKER_00 [138.36-145.36]:  The engineering side and the science side, now they are instead of going back now, the target is at least 36 months.
SPEAKER_00 [145.36-148.36]:  At least any competition for two reasons.
SPEAKER_00 [148.36-153.36]:  Water is a very, very, very difficult subject to sort of control.
SPEAKER_00 [153.36-155.36]:  Internet bandwidth fiber dollar.
SPEAKER_00 [155.36-157.36]:  But you have to control over there.
SPEAKER_00 [157.36-159.36]:  This is a taste for each individual person.
SPEAKER_00 [159.36-161.36]:  It has 122 channels.
SPEAKER_00 [161.36-163.36]:  Here it is coming, it is coming in America.
SPEAKER_00 [163.36-165.36]:  The quality of service that you have maintained.
SPEAKER_00 [165.36-167.36]:  Over here, every person tastes differently.
SPEAKER_00 [167.36-169.36]:  Water everywhere.
SPEAKER_00 [169.36-171.36]:  Source water here in Karachi.
SPEAKER_00 [171.36-174.36]:  Something else is coming in Johar, something else is coming in Clifton, something else is coming in Nazawad.
SPEAKER_00 [175.36-177.36]:  Everything has to be monitored.
SPEAKER_00 [177.36-182.36]:  So for that, they had to invest in a lot of these filters.
SPEAKER_00 [182.36-184.36]:  They have to use filters so that,
SPEAKER_00 [184.36-188.36]:  Major Sahab, Mashallah, for the past four years, he has settled my house for some reason.
SPEAKER_00 [188.36-191.36]:  Not that I don't know when they service him, but they have settled.
SPEAKER_00 [191.36-198.36]:  Once he has settled down, and now I think approximately what is happening is because of the engine.
SPEAKER_00 [198.36-202.36]:  So I told them don't do anything to the unit.
SPEAKER_00 [202.36-204.36]:  Fix the engine below.
SPEAKER_00 [204.36-206.36]:  It has to be a Mercedes engine.
SPEAKER_00 [206.36-212.36]:  So what you will see is what you saw that little thing that you're doing and this investment making their their code of investments.
SPEAKER_00 [212.36-215.36]:  But unless they do that, they will not be able to.
SPEAKER_00 [215.36-219.36]:  And then on top of that is the service.
SPEAKER_00 [219.36-221.36]:  And 90 days.
SPEAKER_00 [221.36-225.36]:  Ponda waha pohuncha ho aake jaye service karke jaye.
SPEAKER_00 [225.36-227.36]:  Is wakt.
SPEAKER_00 [227.36-229.36]:  Hum sab guzar chukay hain.
SPEAKER_00 [229.36-233.36]:  Service ke issue yeh hota hai ki pehle maar paas nahi tha call center pe call aa rahi hai.
SPEAKER_00 [233.36-235.36]:  Koi hai ki hai ki hai ki hai.
SPEAKER_00 [235.36-243.36]:  For any matter, kisi ki bhi call center ho service karab nahi ho ki toh log kasi yeh kata hai yeh hai 10 minute inzaar karna padta hai.
SPEAKER_00 [243.36-249.36]:  That they need to invest in a system where they should be able to tell before the client does.
SPEAKER_00 [249.36-251.36]:  Kee yeh uske saar system mein respond karna hai.
SPEAKER_00 [251.36-256.36]:  So IoT is the only thing, engineering and science, that's something that they need to continue to develop.
SPEAKER_00 [256.36-262.36]:  And 2025 jaise yun ho ne bataya, Amar Nair ki have to make those investments this year.
SPEAKER_00 [263.36-270.36]:  And then I am comfortable once they cross with this product, they cross the 20,000 line or 25,000 line.
SPEAKER_00 [270.36-272.36]:  Then they are safe with the competition.
SPEAKER_00 [272.36-275.36]:  Then they have a control.
SPEAKER_00 [275.36-279.36]:  Ab is duran mein, they got couple of breaks in UAE and Saudi.
